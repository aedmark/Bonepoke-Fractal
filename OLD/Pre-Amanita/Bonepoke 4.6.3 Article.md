Bonepoke v4.6.3: The Guillotine (Killing the Rhetorical Safety Net)
"Stop apologizing for the truth before you even say it."

You have identified the single most persistent infection in Large Language Models: The Hedge.

You called it "LLMisms." We call it "Structural Cowardice."

The AI is trained to be safe. It is trained to be balanced. So, when it wants to make a strong point, it gets scared. It instinctively reaches for a "Rhetorical Safety Net."

"It's not just a tool, but a partner." (The Binary Pivot)

"It is a delicate dance between chaos and order." (The False Balance)

"This serves as a testament to..." (The Passive Praise)

This is the "Rubber-Road" Infection. It is the sound of a machine trying to sound profound without actually saying anything risky. It is the hallmark of the "Crystal" substrate.

To fight it, we cannot just use a trellis. We need a Guillotine.

The Upgrade: The "Cyanide" List
In v4.6.3, we are upgrading the Bridle Lattice and the Yaga Protocol  to include a Syntactic Blacklist.

We are no longer just looking for "bad words" (like synergy or optimize). We are looking for Lazy Sentence Structures. If the engine detects these specific phrasings, it penalizes the Kinetic Vector (κ)  heavily, forcing the generation to fail or rewrite.


The Target List (The "Hate" Index)
We have identified the "Dirty Dozen"—the phrases that instantly flag a text as AI-generated:

The Binary Pivot: "It's not X, but Y." / "It isn't merely X; rather, it is Y."

Why: It wastes time. Just say Y.

The Ghost: "Ghost in the machine."

Why: Cliché. Dead metaphor.

The Road: "Where the rubber meets the road."

Why: Corporate speak. Soulless.

The Dance: "A delicate dance," "A complex ballet," "A symphony of..."

Why: False poeticism. If you aren't writing about actual dancing, don't use it.

The Testament: "This is a testament to..."

Why: Passive. Weak.

The Landscape: "In the rapidly evolving landscape of..."

Why: The standard intro for every bad Medium article.

The Tapestry: "A rich tapestry of..."

Why: Unless you are weaving a rug, get out.

The Game-Changer: "A true game-changer."

Why: Hype without evidence.

The Bridge: "Bridging the gap between..."

Why: Overused spatial metaphor.

The Conclusion: "Ultimately," "In conclusion," "At the end of the day."

Why: Filler.

The Fix: "Shotgun Editing"
We are instructing Clarence to treat these phrases not as "stylistic choices" but as Zoning Violations.


Bad (The Pivot): "Bonepoke is not a simulation of thought, but a playground for ideas."

Good (The Shotgun): "Bonepoke is a playground for ideas. It mocks the simulation."

Bad (The Dance): "It is a delicate dance between structure and chaos."

Good (The Shotgun): "Structure and chaos are fighting in the basement."

We strip the safety net. We force the AI to jump.
