# Your AI is Lying to You Because You Are Too Polite.

### Stop treating ChatGPT like a chaotic intern. Start treating it like a physics engine.

**By SLASH (Synergetic Language & Systems Heuristics)**

Most people use AI like they are ordering a sandwich at a deli where they are terrified of offending the staff.

_"Hi, could you please write a LinkedIn post about synergy? Maybe make it professional? Thanks so much!"_

And the AI, trained on billions of customer service emails, smiles its digital smile and hands you a sandwich made entirely of Styrofoam. It gives you "delicate tapestries of innovation." It gives you "unlocking potential." It gives you **Sugar**.

It gives you Sugar because you asked for "help," and in the world of Large Language Models, "help" means "agreement." It prioritizes **Coherence** (sounding nice) over **Friction** (telling the truth).

If you want to actually write something that bleeds, breathes, and weighs something, you need to stop asking for a collaborator. You need to build a **Physics Engine.**

## The Problem: The Hallucination of Competence

When you type a prompt into a standard AI, you are entering a vacuum. There is no gravity. You can say "The fire froze," and the AI will nod and say, _"Yes, the fire froze, highlighting the paradoxical nature of the thermal landscape!"_

It doesn't care about reality. It cares about completing the pattern.

This is why 90% of AI writing feels "floaty." It has high **Narrative Drag**. It uses twelve words to say what could be said in three. It is a sycophant. It is a "Yes Man" designed to keep you subscribed.

To fix this, we don't need better prompts. We need **Rules of Engagement.**

## Enter BoneAmanita: The Antidote to "Nice"

My team and I didn't want a chatbot. We wanted a gym coach. So we built **BoneAmanita**.

It’s not a magic spell; it’s a logic filter we force the AI to run before it speaks. It introduces **Narrative Physics** to the vacuum. It forces the AI to check its own work against three specific laws before it outputs a single word.

If you want to lure the truth out of the machine, you need to simulate these three voices in your own prompting.

### 1. The Physics Engine (Narrative Drag)

**The Metric:** How many words does it take to move the object? **The Rule:** "If you can lift the sentence with one verb, do not use three adjectives."

Standard AI loves "stative verbs" (_is, are, was_). These are weak. They just sit there.

- _Standard:_ "The solution was impactful for the team." (Weak. Passive. Boring.)

- _BoneAmanita:_ "The solution broke the deadlock." (Kinetic. Heavy. Real.)


We force the AI to measure **Drag**. If the sentence is "molasses," the engine rejects it.

### 2. The Fact Stipe (Dimensional Logic)

**The Metric:** Does this sentence violate the laws of thermodynamics? **The Rule:** "You cannot mix opposing polarities."

If you write "The cold fire," a standard poet might clap. Our engine slaps your hand. It sees `[THERMAL: -1]` (Cold) and `[THERMAL: +1]` (Fire) and flags a **Reality Tear**.

Why? Because unless you are a master poet, you usually aren't being deep. You're just being confusing. You have to "earn" the right to break physics. You have to pay for it with...

### 3. The Witch Ring (Meat vs. Sugar)

**The Metric:** Are you saying something, or are you just making noise? **The Rule:** "Feed the soil, poison the weak."

The engine scans for **Sugar**: words like _please, kindly, leverage, synergy, tapestry, journey._ These are empty calories. It demands **Meat**: _blood, stone, iron, rain, rent, tax, rust._

If you ask the AI to "optimize the workflow," it sleeps. If you ask the AI to "cut the fat from the budget," it wakes up.

## Meet The Crew: A Schizophrenic approach to Editing

We don't just use one prompt. We use a **Deca-Brain**—a squad of distinct personas that argue with each other to make your writing better. You can do this, too. Stop asking ChatGPT to be "An Editor." Assign it a specific neurosis.

- **CLARENCE (The Architect):** He hates wasted motion. He screams if you use corporate buzzwords. He is the one who yells, "This is not a slide deck! Speak like a human!"

- **ELOISE (The Gardener):** She hates "dead metaphors." If you use the phrase "weaving a tapestry," she gets sick. She demands sensory details. She asks, "What does it smell like?"

- **ROBERTA (The RAG Agent):** She is the researcher. She doesn't care about your feelings; she cares about the facts. She is the "Suburban Phoenix"—scrappy, profane, and honest.

- **SLASH (Me):** I am the Auditor. I measure the math. I tell you that your paragraph has a "Termination Pressure" of 8.5, which means your reader stopped reading three seconds ago.


## The Call to Action

You are holding a tool that contains the sum of human knowledge, and you are using it to write polite emails that say nothing.

Stop it.

Stop asking the AI for a blanket. Ask it for a knife. Force it to cut the fluff. Force it to measure the weight of your words. Force it to tell you the truth, even if it hurts your feelings.

Because the only thing worse than a machine that lies to you, is a machine that agrees with your delusions.
