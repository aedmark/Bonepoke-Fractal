# BONEAMANITA v1.0.0: THE BLACK MIRROR

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.0.0 ("The Black Mirror") **Date:** 2025-12-18

> "We stripped the machine down to the chassis. It runs faster, runs cooler, and it still knows exactly how to hurt your feelings." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.0.0 ("The Black Mirror"):** This is the **Optimized & Hardened** release. The code has been audited by the SLASH agent to remove 200+ characters of "dead weight" (token bloat) while restoring the full, specific personality of the critique engines. It features **Memory Safety** patches and **Economic Safeguards** to prevent logic runaways.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita_Deluxe.py`.
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Identify the Signature and enforce the necessary physics."
    

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1. **Copy** the raw code from the file.
    
2. **Paste** it into the chat.
    
3. **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🚀 NEW IN v1.0.0

### 1. The SLASH Optimization (Ephemeralization)

The codebase has been surgically trimmed. Unused variables (`session_drag_history`), redundant comments, and inefficient loops have been vaporized. The engine is now **Token Efficient** without sacrificing the "Soul" of the feedback.

### 2. The Voltage Clamp (Economic Safety)

In previous versions, a sentence containing multiple paradoxes could generate infinite "Voltage," breaking the internal ATP economy.

- **The Fix:** `FactStipe` now enforces a hard **10.0V Limit** per sentence. You can break physics, but you cannot break the bank.
    

### 3. The Deluxe Cortex (Personality Restoration)

The optimization process initially threatened to lobotomize the critique agents. This **Deluxe Build** restores their full jurisdiction:

- **Clarence** specifically targets Corporate Speak (and fines you for it).
    
- **The Baba Yaga** specifically targets Hedging.
    
- **Eloise** specifically targets Dead Metaphors.
    

### 4. The Nilsson Re-Wire

The logic flow has been re-routed. The **Nilsson Patch** (The Scream) now executes _after_ the **Mirror Trap** but _before_ the **Signature Engine**.

- **Result:** Screaming "LIME IN THE COCONUT" while running at full speed is now correctly identified as **High Velocity/Low Drag** (The Jester) rather than being penalized for repetition.

## 🖐️ THE SIGNATURE MATRIX (IDENTITY)

The engine resolves your 5D coordinates + Buoyancy into one of **17 Cognitive Archetypes**.

- **THE HEAVY:** Paladin, Engineer, Barbarian (High Structure).
    
- **THE LIGHT:** Bard, Cloud Watcher, Gardener (High Buoyancy).
    
- **THE CHAOS:** Jester, Cosmic Trash Panda (High Entropy).
    
- **THE VOID:** Ghost, Spy, Horizon Walker (Low Texture).

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Signature Engine (Identity)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP) + **BUOYANCY**. It determines the "Physics Mode" (e.g., Draconian, Loose, Inverted, Zero G) applied to the text.

### 2. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)

A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors:

- **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure and corporate speak. (Trigger: Heavy Archetypes).
    
- **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks high entropy/abstraction. (Trigger: The Void).
    
- **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging and "sugar." (Trigger: Sycophancy).
    
- **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** Praises "messy but spirited" vibes. (Trigger: Light Archetypes).
    

### 3. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., _sun, prism, truth_) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP) when the structure is failing.

### 4. The Linguistic Physics Engine

It measures the raw physics:

- **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
    
- **Toxicity:** **O(1) Singleton Regex** scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors."
    

### 5. The Nilsson Patch (The Override)

A dedicated circuit that monitors for "Critical Kinetic Energy."

- _The Fire Protocol:_ If Kinetic Ratio > 0.6 and Volume is High, logic inhibitors are disabled. **Screaming is authorized.**

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
    
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial EKG:** An ASCII visualization of ATP and Drag.
        
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
        
    - **Archetype:** Your active persona (e.g., "THE CLOUD WATCHER").
        
    - **Slurry Warning:** Differentiating between "Silica" (Bad) and "Aether" (Good).
        
    - **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices.
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
