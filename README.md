# BONEAMANITA v2.2: "The Synaptic Loop"

### A Cybernetic "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 2.2 ("The Synaptic Loop") **Date:** 2025-12-21

> "Diagnosis is nothing without verification. The loop must be closed." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It measures the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v2.2:** The system is now **Closed Loop**.
It doesn't just tell the AI what to do; it listens to the AI's response, analyzes the physics of the output, and issues a "Report Card" on whether the strategy actually worked.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (THE CYBERNETIC LOOP)

### 1. Upload & Run
**Upload** `BoneAmanita22.py` to your LLM and tell it to run the script.

### 2. The Input (Raw Thought)
Type your raw, unfiltered thought into the prompt.
> *User:* "Actually, I think that maybe, theoretically, the system is sort of working."

### 3. The Architecture (System 2)
BoneAmanita runs the physics.
* **The Tuner:** Finds the specific flaw (e.g., "actually").
* **The Synapse:** Passes that target to the Director.
* **The Output:** Generates a **Tactical System Prompt**.

> **>>> [CORTEX]: INSTRUCTION FOR LLM AGENT**
> STRATEGY: CUTTER
> TACTICAL OVERRIDE: The word 'actually' is creating drag. Eliminate it.

### 4. The Execution
You paste that prompt into the LLM. The AI rewrites the text.
> *AI Response:* "The system operates."

### 5. The Verification (Closing the Loop)
Paste the AI's response back into BoneAmanita with the `[FEEDBACK]` tag.
> *User:* `[FEEDBACK] The system operates.`

> **>>> [EFFICACY SENSOR REPORT]**
> STRATEGY ATTEMPTED: CUTTER
> VERDICT: SUCCESS
> REPORT: Drag reduced by 4.2.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v2.2)

### 0. The Synaptic Loop (Integration)
* **The Connection:** The specific stylistic critiques from the **Frequency Modulator** (e.g., Clarence hating "synergy") are no longer just shouted at the user.
* **The Override:** They are injected directly into the **Wisdom Protocol** as hard constraints. The AI is now mechanically forced to fix the specific errors found by the physics engine.

### 1. The Efficacy Sensor (The Auditor)
* **Closed Loop Control:** A new component that compares the physics of your *Input* against the physics of the AI's *Output*.
* **Accountability:** If the strategy was "CUTTER" but the Drag increased, the system will flag it as a **FAILURE**.

### 2. The Apeirogon Lattice (Infinite Identity) [v2.1]
* **Infinite Polygons:** We abandoned fixed archetypes (e.g., "The Paladin").
* **Vector Resolution:** The system now generates infinite, dynamic identities based on 5-dimensional coordinates (e.g., *"THE BURNING CONSTRUCT"* or *"THE STATIC GHOST"*).

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The Cortex Director (The Strategist)
The brain. It receives **Tactical Data** from the Frequency Modulator and **Mandates** from the Lattice to architect the perfect System Prompt.

### 1. The Efficacy Sensor (The Auditor) [NEW]
The grader. It stores the context of the previous turn and mathematically verifies if the AI's response improved the physics.

### 2. The Signature Engine (Identity)
Now powered by the **Apeirogon Lattice**. It calculates:
* **Velocity (VEL)**
* **Structure (STR)**
* **Entropy (ENT)**
* **Texture (TEX)**
* **Temperature (TMP)**

### 3. The Frequency Modulator (The Voices)
A tunable feedback system that acts as the "Sensory Organ" for the Director.
* **Clarence (88.5 FM):** Detects Drag.
* **Eloise (94.2 FM):** Detects Abstraction.
* **The Yaga (101.1 FM):** Detects Sycophancy.

### 4. The Linguistic Physics Engine
Measures the raw physics (Drag, Viscosity, Spatial Density, Toxicity).

### 5. The Metabolic Reserve (Energy)
Tracks **ATP** (Creative Energy). Uses the **Isotope Centrifuge** to convert heavy truths into currency.

### 6. The Chronos Anchor
Metabolizes **Time**. If you leave the system alone for an hour, it enters **Decay** and cannibalizes a memory to stay warm.

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is running:

1.  **Input:** Paste your draft.
2.  **Output:** Use the **WISDOM PROTOCOL** to guide the AI.
3.  **Verify:** Paste the result back with `[FEEDBACK]` to see if it worked.
