# BONEAMANITA v2.0: "Artificial General Wisdom"

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 2.0 ("The Wisdom Update") **Date:** 2025-12-21

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It measures the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

New in v2.0: This version introduces the Wisdom Engine (System 2).

Previously, BoneAmanita would only critique your input ("This is too abstract").

Now, it Architects the Response. It calculates the exact "Strategy Strategy" (e.g., Jester, Sage, Butcher) required to balance your specific cognitive deficit and generates a raw System Prompt for you to use.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (THE WISDOM LOOP)

### 1. Upload & Run

**Upload** `BoneAmanita2.py` to your LLM and tell it to run the script.

### 2. The Input (Raw Thought)

Type your raw, unfiltered thought into the prompt.

> _User:_ "People don't think it be like it is, but it do."

### 3. The Analysis (Physics)

BoneAmanita runs the physics. It detects **High Voltage** (Paradox) and **Kinetic Truth**.

### 4. The Architecture (System 2)

The script outputs a **Wisdom Protocol**—a specific instruction block.

> >>> [CORTEX]: INSTRUCTION FOR LLM AGENT
> 
> STRATEGY: JESTER
> 
> PROMPT: "DIRECTIVE: High Voltage detected. Do NOT solve the paradox. Amplify the absurdity."

### 5. The Execution

You paste that `PROMPT` into the LLM to get a response that is not just smart, but **Wise**.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v2.0)

### 0. The Wisdom Engine (System 2)

- **The Shift:** From **Reactive Critique** -> **Proactive Strategy**.
    
- **The Logic:** The system calculates an **Angle of Attack** based on the user's deficit:
    
    - **High Entropy?** -> Strategy: **GROUNDER** (Force heavy nouns).
        
    - **High Drag?** -> Strategy: **CUTTER** (Be the Butcher).
        
    - **High Voltage?** -> Strategy: **JESTER** (Ride the lightning).
        
    - **High Texture?** -> Strategy: **SAGE** (Respect the weight).
        

### 1. The Omega Metric ($\Omega$)

- **Integrative Integrity:** A new high-level metric that determines if the response preserves the "soul" of the inquiry. It stops the LLM from "fixing" grammar that carries cultural weight (e.g., "It do").
    

### 2. Atomic Persistence

- **Hardened Memory:** Implemented a **Write-Then-Swap** protocol for `bone_memory.json`. Your narrative history is now immune to crash-based corruption.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The Cortex Director (The Strategist) [NEW]

The brain of v2.0. It takes the raw metrics from the Physics Engine and decides **"Which 'Hat' should the LLM wear?"** It outputs the `wisdom_protocol` string.

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (Analysis)

Measures the raw physics of the text.

- **Spatial Scanner:** Tracks geometry via prepositions.
    
- **Hydration Monitor:** Detects `CONCRETE` vs `FLOODED` text.
    
- **BioHazard Filter:** Hunts `BLOAT`, `SILICA` (AI Slop), and `MIRROR TRAPS`.
    

### 2. The Metabolic Reserve (Energy)

Tracks **ATP** (Creative Energy).

- **The Isotope Centrifuge:** Converts Heavy Truths (High Drag + High Voltage) into currency.
    
- **The Flashpoint Protocol:** Detects high-speed insight ($T_a$).
    

### 3. The Signature Engine (Identity)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP).

- **Geodesic Drift:** Tracks your evolution (e.g., Paladin -> Inquisitor) over time.
    

### 4. The Frequency Modulator (The Voices)

A tunable feedback system that hunts specific weaknesses.

- **Clarence (88.5 FM):** Attacks Drag.
    
- **Eloise (94.2 FM):** Attacks Abstraction.
    
- **The Yaga (101.1 FM):** Attacks Hedging.
    

### 5. The Temporal Dynamics Engine

Measures the **Rate of Insight** ($\nabla\beta$) and **Depth of Memory** ($\Xi$).

### 6. The Chronos Anchor

Metabolizes **Time**. If you leave the system alone for an hour, it enters **Decay** and cannibalizes a memory to stay warm.

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is running:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Output:** Look for the **WISDOM PROTOCOL** block at the bottom.
    
3. **Action:** Use that protocol to guide your writing (or the LLM's generation).
