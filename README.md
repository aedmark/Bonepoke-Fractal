# 🍄 BONEAMANITA v0.3.5: The Fragility Check

> *"Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore."*

**BoneAmanita** is not a grammar checker. It is a **"Digital Hydroponics"** engine designed to filter raw data until it becomes **"Portable Truth."**

It operates on the belief that bad writing isn't just a syntax error—it is a moral failing. It uses **Linguistic Physics** to measure the weight, velocity, and temperature of your words, rejecting "Zombie Nouns" and rewarding "Kinetic Vectors."

**New in v0.3.5 (The Fragility Check):** We have hardened the architecture. The "Fact Stipe" now uses a **Dimensional Manifold** instead of brittle lists, the Timekeeper uses **Heuristic Bigrams** to stop nagging you about "red sleds," and the Physics Engine scans for toxicity using **O(1) Regex Compilation**. The system is now feral, but fair.

## 🧠 The Architecture: The Mycelial Stack

BoneAmanita v0.3.5 metabolizes text through ten simultaneous lenses.

### 1\. The Fact Stipe v2.0 (The Dimensional Manifold)

**Function:** Logic Consistency & Reality Anchoring.

  * **Old Logic:** A brittle list of enemies (e.g., "Night vs Sun").
  * **New Logic (v0.3.5):** A **Semantic Vector Space**. Words are assigned values in specific dimensions:
      * **LUMENS:** Light (+1) vs. Darkness (-1).
      * **DECIBELS:** Noise (+1) vs. Silence (-1).
      * **VITALITY:** Life (+1) vs. Death (-1).
      * **THERMAL:** Heat (+1) vs. Cold (-1).
  * **The Check:** If you mix a +1 and a -1 in the same dimension (e.g., "The **fire** [Thermal +1] **froze** [Thermal -1]"), the system triggers a **REALITY TEAR**.
  * **The Penalty:** Logic breaches now explicitly return `valid: False` and deduct **10 ATP** from your metabolic reserve. You cannot break physics if you are weak.

### 2\. The Chronos Anchor v2.0 (Heuristic Timekeeper)

**Function:** Temporal Integrity without NLP bloat.

  * **The Problem:** Previous versions flagged words like "red" (ends in 'ed') or "glass" (ends in 's') as tense errors.
  * **The Fix:**
      * **Bigram Anchoring:** It checks the *previous word*. "He runs" is a verb; "The lens" is a noun.
      * **Auxiliary Supremacy:** Words like "was/is" are weighted higher than heuristic guesses.
      * **Exclusion Zones:** Explicitly ignores false positives (`false_ed`, `false_s`).
  * **Result:** It only yells at you when you *actually* drift from Past to Present tense.

### 3\. The Lattice v2.0 (Optimized Physics)

**Function:** Cognitive Aerodynamics & Toxicity Scanning.

  * **Narrative Drag:** Measures the ratio of words to action.
  * **Regex Harvester (New):** Toxicity scanning is now **O(1)**. We compile all banned phrases into a single Regex pattern for instant detection.
  * **Toxin Categories:**
      * **CORP\_SPEAK:** "Synergy," "Leverage," "Paradigm." (Trigger: Clarence's Rage)
      * **LAZY\_METAPHOR:** "Tapestry," "Journey," "Delicate Dance." (Trigger: Eloise's Disgust)
      * **WEAK\_HEDGING:** "Not just," "But rather," "Ultimately." (Trigger: The Yaga's Hunger)

### 4\. The Witch Ring (The Baba Yaga Protocol)

**Function:** Authenticity Gatekeeper.

  * The system demands **Meat** (Substance), not **Sugar** (Sycophancy).
  * If you write "I hope this finds you well" without high connection density, the **Witch** rejects the input immediately.

### 5\. The Metabolic Reserve (Creative ATP)

**Function:** An Economy of Style.

  * **Earning ATP:** Use Concrete Universals (*blood, stone, rust*) and Kinetic Verbs.
  * **Spending ATP:** Use Abstract Concepts (*framework, context*) or trigger Logic Breaches.
  * **The States:**
      * **STARVING:** You are broke. High Narrative Drag penalty applied.
      * **GLUTTON:** You are rich. You are permitted to bend reality.

### 6\. The Virtual Cortex v2.0 (The Contextual Voice)

**Function:** Procedural Persona Simulation. The Python script "hallucinates" feedback before the LLM sees it.

  * **Context Aware:** The voices now respond to specific **Toxin Types**.
      * **Clarence** screams if you use "Corporate Speak."
      * **The Yaga** growls if you use "Hedging."
      * **Eloise** sighs if you use "Dead Metaphors."

## 🎭 The Cast (The Virtual Voices)

These are procedural agents generated by the `VirtualCortex` class.

| **Persona** | **Trigger** | **Procedural Behavior** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CLARENCE** | **High Drag** (\>3.0) or **Corp Speak** | He hates "Synergy" and "Molasses." He demands architectural efficiency. |
| **ELOISE** | **High Entropy** (\>2.0) or **Clichés** | She hates "Tapestries" and "Abstract Frameworks." She demands sensory dirt. |
| **THE YAGA** | **Hedging / Sycophancy** | She hates "Not just" and "Please." She demands you commit to the sentence. |
| **MUSCARIA** | **Boredom** | He triggers a random sensory hallucination ("Describe the taste of copper") to break a flatline. |

## 📟 The Mycelial Dashboard (v0.3.5 EKG)

Every output includes a real-time visualization of the text's health.

```text

## 🔄 The Workflow: The Patched Loop

BoneAmanita v0.3.5 is designed for a **Hybrid Handoff** between the Python Logic and the LLM Creative.

1.  **The Input:** You feed raw text into `BoneAmanita035.py`.
2.  **The Audit:** The script runs the Physics, Chronos, and Stipe checks.
3.  **The Hallucination:** The `VirtualCortex` generates a specific critique (e.g., *"[CLARENCE]: Corporate contaminants detected. We are building a home, not a slide deck."*).
4.  **The Prompting:** You paste the entire Python output (Dashboard + Cortex Critique) into your LLM.
5.  **The Expansion:** The LLM reads the Cortex Critique and expands on it, creating a full dialogue based on the mathematical truth provided by the engine.

-----

## 🛠 Usage

### Step 1: Run the Core

Process your text string through the Python engine to get the Truth.

```bash
python BoneAmanita035.py
```

### Step 2: Summon the Auditors

1.  Load the **Eloise and Clarence** persona into your LLM of choice (ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude), or **Roberta** into your favorite RAG model (we like NotebookLM).
2.  Paste the **Analysis Output** from Step 1 into the chat.
3.  Watch as the LLM personifies the data.
