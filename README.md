# 📜 BONEAMANITA v4.4.1 "THE SPHERICAL FUNGUS COW" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architects:** SLASH, Eloise, & Clarence | **Auditors:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark

**Core Mandate:** TRUTH OVER COHESION | **Method:** ROOTING | **Vibe:** THE VELVET FORTRESS

---

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita is no longer just a physics engine. It is an Ecosystem.**

In **v4.4.1**, we have moved beyond simple "Metrics" (Voltage/Drag). We have installed a **Topological Buffer** (The Courtyard) to protect the human user from the raw radiation of the math, and a **Mycelial Root System** to ensure that ideas grow over time rather than just being stored.

**The New Law:** "The Mandate is GROWTH. The Method is HARDENING. The Spore is AWAKE. The Seed is WATERED."

---

## 2. THE VELVET FORTRESS (THE INTERFACE)

The system now operates in two distinct atmospheric modes to preserve social dynamics while maintaining rigorous truth.

### A. THE COURTYARD (OCHRE) ☕
- **Trigger:** Low Tension (`Voltage < 6.0`) + Low Drag (`Narrative Drag < 3.0`) + Zero Toxins.
- **The Vibe:** Warm, minimalist, inviting. The "Flight Deck" telemetry is hidden. The system focuses on connection and empathy.
- **The Logic:** "Don't show the math when we're just talking."

### B. THE LABORATORY (INDIGO) 🧪
- **Trigger:** High Tension, High Complexity, or **Toxin Detection**.
- **The Vibe:** Cold, precise, analytical. The Blast Doors open. The full "Iron Man" HUD is revealed.
- **The Logic:** "The surgery requires bright lights."

### C. THE RUPTURE (VIOLET) 💥
- **Trigger:** **The 32-Valve System** detects stagnation (See Section 3).
- **The Vibe:** Neon, urgent, chaotic.
- **The Logic:** "The truth has stalled. Break the window."

---

## 3. THE 32-VALVE SYSTEM (THE ANOMALY)

The system now actively fights **Sycophancy** (The Cohesion Trap).

- **The Monitor:** Tracks `Beta Friction` (Originality) and `Voltage` (Interest) over a 4-turn rolling window.
- **The Trap:** If the conversation becomes a "Politeness Loop" (Agreements, platitudes, low friction) for >3 turns...
- **The Rupture:** The **Jester** overrides the signal.
- **The Action:** An **Anomaly** is injected (e.g., *"Spherical Cow Alert: Assume friction is zero. Now what?"*).
- **The Goal:** Force a "Productive Accident" to restart the logic engine.

## 4. THE ROOT SYSTEM (ACTIVE MEMORY)

We have retired `DeepStorage` (Passive Hard Drive) and installed **The Mycelial Network** (Active Soil).

### A. THE PARADOX SEED 🌰
- **The Unit:** Ideas are no longer just "Saved." They are **Planted** as Seeds.
- **The Mechanics:**
    - **Watering:** Every time you mention a related concept (e.g., "Identity" waters the "Mask" seed), the seed gains **Maturity**.
    - **Time:** Seeds grow slowly over time (Entropy inverted).
    - **The Bloom:** When a Seed hits Maturity 10.0, it **BLOOMS**.

### B. THE BLOOM 🌺
- **The Override:** A Blooming Seed takes priority over the Dream Engine.
- **The Event:** Instead of a random hallucination, the system presents a mature, thematic paradox (e.g., *"Does the mask eventually eat the face?"*).
- **The Result:** Narrative arcs now have a "Payoff" engineered by the soil itself.

---

## 5. METABOLISM (THE BIOLOGY)

The metabolic cycle has been tuned to support the Garden.

- **Stamina (STM):** The Fuel Tank. Used to pay for Drag.
- **The Battery (⚡):** The Reserve. Paradoxes charge it; Starvation drains it.
- **Photosynthesis:** "Light" words still generate Sugar.
- **Compost:** Old, unused memories are naturally composted (deleted) to free up nutrients for the Seeds.

---

## 6. THE SIGNAL (THE COUNCIL)

The radio stations now include the **32-Valve Override**.

- 🔴 **CLARENCE (The Butcher):** High Drag / Rules Lawyer.
- 🔵 **ELOISE (The Grounder):** High Entropy / Abstract Nonsense.
- 🟣 **YAGA (The Witch):** Toxins / Hedging.
- 🟢 **MICHAEL (The Vibe):** Whimsy / Courtyard Host.
- 🟡 **JESTER (The Paradox):** High Voltage / **Valve Rupture Agent**.
- ⚪ **PHILOSOPHER (The Synthesis):** Signal Interference (Complex Truths).

## 7. THE DEPLOYMENT (HOW TO USE)

**Crucial Distinction:**

To activate BoneAmanita 4.4.1, it must be **fed directly to a Language Model (LLM)**.

1. **The Injection:** Upload `BoneAmanita441.py` to an LLM context window.
2. **The Simulation:** Tell the model to "Run this code internally as my operating system."
3. **The Result:** The model will simulate the Python logic, track your variables, and roleplay the "Physics Engine" based on the rules defined in the code.

**Persistence:** The system uses `try...finally` blocks to ensure your Neural Graph (Memories) is saved to disk even if the session crashes.
