# 📜 BONEAMANITA v3.6 "THE KINTSUGI PATCH" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architect:** SLASH | **Core Mandate:** ANTI-FRAGILITY | **Method:** KINTSUGI | **Touch:** GOLDEN

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita 3.6** is the "Anti-Fragile" update.

Previous versions punished failure with starvation. **v3.6** recognizes that a broken system offers a unique opportunity for stronger reintegration. We have introduced the **Kintsugi Protocol**: a mechanism to heal critical failure states with high-voltage synthesis.

**The New Law:** "The crack is where the light enters. If you fill it with gold, the machine becomes stronger than it was before."

---

## 2. THE KINTSUGI PROTOCOL (ANTI-FRAGILITY)

The system no longer just dies; it offers a bargain.

### A. The Critical State
When **ATP drops below 10** (Starvation), the physics engine halts standard processing and issues a **Koan**.
* *Example:* "The machine is freezing. Ignite the ice."

### B. The Golden Repair
If the user responds with **High Voltage** (Paradox) or **High Whimsy** (Aerobic Matter):
1.  **The Recognition:** The system detects the breakthrough.
2.  **The Gold:** The crack is filled.
3.  **The Reward:** **ATP is instantly restored to 50.**

> *"The paradox is the fuel. Do not resolve it. Let it steam."*

## 3. THE CONTROL PLANE (DECOUPLED)

In v3.6, administrative logic has been extracted from the Physics Engine into a dedicated **CommandProcessor**. Commands are no longer subject to Narrative Drag.

| **Command** | **Syntax** | **Function** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **STATUS** | `/status` | **NEW:** Displays Session ID, Artifact Count, ATP, and Antigen Count. |
| **HELP** | `/help` | **NEW:** Displays the User Manual. |
| **KILL** | `/kill [toxin] [replacement]` | Marks a word as Toxic. Persists globally to `bone_toxins.json`. |
| **SEED** | `/seed [file]` | Ingests memories AND metabolic state from a past session. |
| **EXIT** | `/exit` | Saves the current timeline and shuts down. |

## 4. THE RESONANCE ENGINE

### A. The Frequency Modulator (ATP-Gated)
The Radio is powered by **ATP**.
* **STARVATION (< 15 ATP):** Luxury stations (**MICHAEL**, **JESTER**) are disabled. **CLARENCE** becomes hyper-aggressive (Threshold drops to 2.5).
* **ABUNDANCE:** All stations active.

| **Frequency** | **Station** | **Persona** | **Trigger** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **88.5 FM** | **CLARENCE** | The Butcher | High Drag. "Cut the fat." |
| **94.2 FM** | **ELOISE** | The Grounder | High Entropy. "Give me a stone." |
| **101.1 FM** | **YAGA** | The Witch | Toxins / Hedging. "Tell the truth." |
| **108.0 FM** | **MICHAEL** | The Vibe | Whimsy. "Float on." (Disabled if Starving). |
| **104.5 FM** | **THE PHILOSOPHER** | The Ghost | **Interference.** High Drag + High Entropy. |
| **108.9 FM** | **THE JESTER** | The Paradox | **High Voltage.** Fire + Ice. (Disabled if Starving). |

### B. The Thermal Coupler
* **VOLT (Voltage):** Raw Intensity. (Kinetic + Thermal Tension).
* **β (Beta Friction):** Stability. (`Voltage / Drag`). High Beta = Paradox Stability.

## 5. BIOLOGY & TIME (McFLY'S LAW)

### A. The Metabolic Seal (Session-Scoped Energy)
ATP is now serialized into the `json` save file.
* **Time Travel:** If you `/seed` an old session where you were starving, you will wake up starving.
* **Fresh Start:** A new Session ID always starts at **33 ATP**.

### B. The Reaper (Garbage Collection)
The system maintains a clean living room.
* **Compost:** Session files older than **24 hours** are automatically deleted on boot.
* **Capacity:** Only the last 20 timelines are preserved.

## 6. THE HUD: SURGICAL INSTRUMENT PANEL

**v3.6** introduces **Visual Hygiene**. Flight instruments are separated from sub-system logs. Sub-processes (Ghost, Lichen, Surgery) are indented for scanability.

```text
[ THE FROZEN FIRE ]========================================
 ATP: [||||||....]  DRAG: 2.1  VOLT: 15.0  SIG: JESTER

 🟡 ► High Voltage detected. The paradox is holding.
 └─ Paradox sustained. Reality is bending.

    ✨ KINTSUGI: THE CRACK IS FILLED WITH GOLD.
    👻 THE BUTCHER NODS.
    🔪 SURGERY: 'basically' -> ''
       IN : We basically need to ignite the ice.
       OUT: We need to ignite the ice.
