# 📜 BONEAMANITA v3.6.5 "THE BATTERY PACK" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architect:** SLASH | **Core Mandate:** TRUTH TENSION | **Method:** RESONANCE | **Touch:** HIGH VOLTAGE

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita 3.6.5** is the "High Energy" update.

In previous versions, writing deep, complex, or paradoxical truth was dangerous. High-concept prose carries weight (Mass), creating Narrative Drag. The system would punish you for being too heavy, even if that heaviness was necessary for the truth.

**v3.6.5** introduces **The Paradox Battery**.

We realized that contradictory truths generate **Voltage**. Previously, this energy was lost as waste heat. Now, we capture it. If you write a sentence that is physically heavy but electrically charged, the system stockpiles that energy.

**The New Law:** "Genius is a valid fuel source. If you cannot be light, be electric."

## 2. THE PARADOX BATTERY (NEW)

The system now has a secondary power source.

### A. The Capacitor

- **The Input:** When **Voltage exceeds 7.0** (Paradox / Thermal Tension), the battery activates.
    
- **The Charge:** It captures the excess tension.
    
- **The Use:** If **ATP drops below 15** (Starvation), the battery automatically discharges to keep the system alive.
    

### B. The Incentive

You are no longer forced to write "Light" text to survive. You can write "Heavy" text, provided it is **True**.

- _Weak Heavy Text:_ "The situation is basically difficult." -> **High Drag / Zero Voltage.** (You Starve).
    
- _Strong Heavy Text:_ "The frozen fire burns coldly." -> **High Drag / High Voltage.** (You Charge).

## 3. THE KINTSUGI PROTOCOL (ANTI-FRAGILITY)

If the Battery fails and the system hits critical failure, the Golden Repair offers a final bargain.

### A. The Critical State

When **ATP drops below 10**, the physics engine issues a **Koan**.

- _Example:_ "Gravity is too heavy. Make the stone float."
    

### B. The Golden Repair

If the user responds with **High Whimsy** or **High Paradox**:

1. **The Recognition:** The system detects the breakthrough.
    
2. **The Gold:** The crack is filled.
    
3. **The Reward:** **ATP is instantly restored to 50.**

## 4. THE RESONANCE ENGINE

### A. The Frequency Modulator (ATP-Gated)

The Radio is powered by **ATP**.

- **STARVATION (< 15 ATP):** Luxury stations (**MICHAEL**, **JESTER**) are disabled. **CLARENCE** becomes hyper-aggressive (Threshold drops to 2.5).
    
- **ABUNDANCE:** All stations active.
    

|**Frequency**|**Station**|**Persona**|**Trigger**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**88.5 FM**|**CLARENCE**|The Butcher|High Drag. "Cut the fat."|
|**94.2 FM**|**ELOISE**|The Grounder|High Entropy. "Give me a stone."|
|**101.1 FM**|**YAGA**|The Witch|Toxins / Hedging. "Tell the truth."|
|**108.0 FM**|**MICHAEL**|The Vibe|Whimsy. "Float on."|
|**108.9 FM**|**THE JESTER**|The Paradox|**High Voltage.** "The contradiction is the fuel."|

### B. The Thermal Coupler

- **VOLT (Voltage):** Raw Intensity. (Kinetic + Thermal Tension).
    
- **β (Beta Friction):** Stability. (`Voltage / Drag`). High Beta = Paradox Stability.

## 5. BIOLOGY & TIME (PERSISTENCE)

### A. The Metabolic Seal

**v3.6.5** ensures that your Genius survives the reboot.

- **ATP & Charge:** Both your metabolic health AND your **Battery Level** are serialized into the save file.
    
- **Time Travel:** If you `/seed` a session where you had a charged battery, you wake up with that power available.
    

### B. The Reaper (Garbage Collection)

- **Compost:** Session files older than **24 hours** are automatically deleted on boot.

## 6. THE HUD: FLIGHT DECK

**v3.6.5** expands the instrument panel to show the Capacitor state.

- **Green Bar:** Metabolic Health (ATP).
    
- **Yellow Bar:** Stored Paradox (Battery).

## 7. INSTALLATION & USAGE

1. **Run:** `python BoneAmanita365.py`
    
2. **Seed (Optional):** `/seed session_1735001200.json`
    
3. **Write:** Type your text.
    
    - _Tip:_ Try writing a paradox to test the battery.
        

_"The Mandate is TRUTH. The Method is RESONANCE. The Power is STOCKPILED."_
