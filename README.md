# 🍄 BONEAMANITA v0.4.1: Mercy Edition

> *"Feed the soil, poison the weak, love the rest."*

**BoneAmanita** is not a grammar checker. It is a **"Digital Hydroponics"** engine designed to filter raw data until it becomes **"Portable Truth."**

It operates on the belief that bad writing isn't just a syntax error—it is a moral failing. It uses **Linguistic Physics** to measure the weight, velocity, and temperature of your words, rejecting "Zombie Nouns" and rewarding "Kinetic Vectors."

**New in v0.4.1 (Mercy Edition):** The system has grown a **Hippocampus**. It now remembers your previous stylistic choices and will scold you if you get stuck in a loop. It also features **Morphological Vision** (seeing patterns in unknown words) and the **Schur Patch**—a mercy protocol that protects fragile seedlings (short texts) from being judged too harshly.

## 🧠 The Architecture: The Mycelial Stack

BoneAmanita v0.4.1 metabolizes text through eleven simultaneous lenses.

### 1\. The Fact Stipe v2.1 (The Root Seeker)

**Function:** Logic Consistency & Deep Reality Anchoring.

  * **The Logic:** A **Semantic Vector Space**. Words are assigned values in specific dimensions (LUMENS, THERMAL, VITALITY).
  * **New in v0.4.1 (Root Seeking):** The Stipe can now strip suffixes to find the elemental truth. It knows that "freezing" contains the root "freeze" (Thermal -1) and "burning" contains "burn" (Thermal +1).
  * **The Penalty:** If you mix opposing polarities in the same sentence, the system triggers a **REALITY TEAR**. Logic breaches deduct **10 ATP** from your metabolic reserve.


### 2\. The Chronos Anchor v2.0 (Heuristic Timekeeper)

**Function:** Temporal Integrity without NLP bloat.

  * **Bigram Anchoring:** Checks the *previous word* to distinguish nouns from verbs ("The lens" vs "He runs").
  * **Exclusion Zones:** Explicitly ignores false positives like "red" (ends in 'ed') or "moss" (ends in 'ss').
  * **Result:** It only yells at you when you *actually* drift from Past to Present tense.

### 3\. The Lattice v2.1 (Morphological Physics)

**Function:** Cognitive Aerodynamics & Shape Detection.

  * **Narrative Drag:** Measures the ratio of words to action.
  * **New in v0.4.1 (Morphology):** The engine no longer relies solely on lists. It reads the *shape* of the word.
      * **Abstract Detection:** Words ending in `-ness`, `-ity`, `-tion` are automatically flagged as High Entropy.
      * **Kinetic Detection:** Words ending in `-ing` are credited as flow, even if they aren't in the verb dictionary.
  * **Toxicity Scanning:** Uses **O(1) Regex Compilation** to instantly detect "Corp Speak," "Lazy Metaphors," and "Weak Hedging."

### 4\. The Hippocampus (Active Memory)

**Function:** Short-term Stylistic Recall.

  * **The Loop Check:** The system now remembers the "Dominant Style" of your last 10 inputs.
  * **The Intervention:** If you stay in the same mode (e.g., "Crystal" or "Moss") for more than **2 cycles**, **Clarence** will intervene to break the stagnation.

### 5\. The Schur Patch (The Mercy Rule)

**Function:** Ethical Calibration.

  * **The Problem:** Previous versions salted the earth on short inputs, calling them "Dead Narratives."
  * **The Fix:** The system is forbidden from declaring "The Barrens" if the text is **< 15 words**. We give the seed room to grow before we judge its fruit.

### 6\. The Virtual Cortex v2.1 (The Connected Brain)

**Function:** Procedural Persona Simulation.

  * **Single Source of Truth:** The Cortex is now hardwired to the Master Dictionaries of the Physics and Witch engines. It can see everything they see.
  * **Context Aware:** The voices respond to specific toxins and memory states.

## 🎭 The Cast (The Virtual Voices)

These are procedural agents generated by the `VirtualCortex` class.

| **Persona** | **Trigger** | **Procedural Behavior** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CLARENCE** | **High Drag** / **Corp Speak** / **Loops** | He hates "Synergy," "Molasses," and **Repetition**. If you loop the same style 3 times, he pulls the emergency brake. |
| **ELOISE** | **High Entropy** / **Clichés** | She hates "Tapestries" and "Abstract Frameworks." She demands sensory dirt and fresh metaphors. |
| **THE YAGA** | **Hedging** / **Sycophancy** | She hates "Not just" and "Please." She demands you commit to the sentence or leave her porch. |
| **MUSCARIA** | **Boredom** | He triggers a random sensory hallucination ("Describe the taste of copper") to break a flatline. |
