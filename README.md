# BONEAMANITA v0.9.0: THE HELIUM PROTOCOL

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 0.9.0 ("The Helium Protocol") **Date:** 2025-12-18

> "Gravity is not the only law. With enough hot air and light, even a stone can fly."

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v0.9.0 ("The Helium Protocol"):** The engine has evolved beyond simple Newtonian Mechanics (Drag vs. Velocity). It now implements **Aerobic Physics**. The system calculates a **Buoyancy** metric, allowing "Heavy" sentences (High Narrative Drag) to exist _if_ they contain sufficient "Lift" (Aerobic Matter + Wit).

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita09.py`.
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Identify the Signature and enforce the necessary physics."
    

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1. **Copy** the raw code from `BoneAmanita09.py`.
    
2. **Paste** it into the chat.
    
3. **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🚀 NEW IN v0.9.0

### 1. The Helium Protocol (Buoyancy)

Previously, High Narrative Drag (slow, structural sentences) was always penalized. Now, the `SignatureEngine` calculates **BUOYANCY** based on the density of:

- **Aerobic Matter:** Words that float (e.g., _balloon, cloud, feather_).
    
- **Play Verbs:** Kinetic joy (e.g., _twirl, bounce, skip_).
    
- **Spark Markers:** Warmth (e.g., _lovely, strange, glow_).
    

**The Result:** High Buoyancy _forgives_ High Drag.

### 2. The Light Triad (New Archetypes)

Three new personas have been added to the Prism that specifically leverage these Aerobic Physics:

- **THE BARD:** Rhythm over Logic. Logic tears are "poetic license."
    
- **THE GARDENER:** Cultivation over Speed. "Prune the dead, water the living."
    
- **THE CLOUD WATCHER:** Zero G. Drag penalties are disabled to allow for drifting thoughts.
    

### 3. Silica vs. Aether (Refined Slurry Protocol)

The system now distinguishes between two types of "Low Texture" writing:

- **SILICA (Bad):** Low Texture + Low Buoyancy. (Competent but soulless). -> **CRUSH IT.**
    
- **AETHER (Good):** Low Texture + High Buoyancy. (Whimsical and light). -> **ALLOW IT.**

## 🖐️ THE SIGNATURE MATRIX (IDENTITY)

The engine resolves your 5D coordinates + Buoyancy into one of **17 Cognitive Archetypes**.

### The Heavy (High Structure / Survival)

- **THE PALADIN:** Unwavering code. Logic tears are fatal.
    
- **THE ENGINEER:** Structural integrity. No poetic license.
    
- **THE BARBARIAN:** Adjectives are weakness (Drag Multiplier 5.0x).
    

### The Light (High Buoyancy / Warmth)

- **THE BARD:** Powered by rhyme and whimsy.
    
- **THE CLOUD WATCHER:** Permissible stagnation due to beauty.
    
- **THE GARDENER:** Making abstract ideas bloom into sensory details.
    

### The Chaos (High Entropy / Inversion)

- **THE JESTER:** Paradoxes generate momentum.
    
- **THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA:** One man's trash is another raccoon's treasure.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Signature Engine (Identity)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP) plus **BUOYANCY**. It determines the "Physics Mode" (e.g., Draconian, Loose, Inverted, Zero G) applied to the text.

### 2. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)

A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors:

- **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure and corporate speak. (Trigger: Heavy Archetypes).
    
- **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks high entropy/abstraction. (Trigger: The Void).
    
- **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging and "sugar." (Trigger: Sycophancy).
    
- **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** _New in v0.9._ Praises "messy but spirited" vibes. (Trigger: Light Archetypes).
    

### 3. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., _sun, prism, truth_) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP) when the structure is failing.

### 4. The Linguistic Physics Engine

It measures the raw physics:

- **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
    
- **Toxicity:** O(1) scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors."
    

### 5. The Nilsson Patch (The Override)

A dedicated circuit that monitors for "Critical Kinetic Energy."

- _The Fire Protocol:_ If Kinetic Ratio > 0.6 and Volume is High, logic inhibitors are disabled. **Screaming is authorized.**

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
    
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial EKG:** An ASCII visualization of ATP and Drag.
        
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
        
    - **Archetype:** Your active persona (e.g., "THE CLOUD WATCHER").
        
    - **Slurry Warning:** Differentiating between "Silica" (Bad) and "Aether" (Good).
        
    - **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices (Clarence, Eloise, Michael, The Yaga).
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
