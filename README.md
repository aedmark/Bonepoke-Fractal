# BONEAMANITA v2.6: "LAZARUS"

### A Cybernetic "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 2.6 ("LAZARUS") **Date:** 2025-12-21

> "The Mandate is TRUTH. The Method is RHYTHM. The Anchor is MEMORY." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs). It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It measures the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v2.6 (LAZARUS):** The Soul has been restored.

We have maintained the **Ephemeralization** of v2.5 (Single File, Zero Dependencies, $O(n)$ Speed), but we have grafted the **living organs** back into the chassis. It actively commands the LLM (`>>> DIRECTIVE`), it burns memories to survive time gaps (`Heirloom Sacrifice`), and it exposes the raw vector mathematics (`VEL`, `TEX`, `ENT`).

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (THE ZERO-DEPENDENCY LOOP)

### 1. Upload & Run

**Upload/Paste** `BoneAmanita26.py` to your LLM or Python environment.

-   **NO CONFIG FILE NEEDED.** The "Pantry" is baked into the kernel.
-   **Note:** The script will automatically create a tiny `bone_memory_lazarus.json` file to track your history, energy, and stored "Heirlooms."

### 2. The Input (Raw Thought)

Type your raw, unfiltered thought into the prompt.

> _User:_ "Actually, I think that maybe, theoretically, the stone and iron are sort of heavy."

### 3. The Architecture (Lazarus Engine)

BoneAmanita processes the text through **Four Layers**:

1.  **The Physics:** Instant calculation of Drag, Entropy, Viscosity, and Vectors.
2.  **The Time:** Checks the gap since last input.
    -   **DECAY (>1h):** +3.0 Drag. *Action:* Burns a stored memory (e.g., 'iron') to stay warm.
3.  **The Tuner:** Locks onto specific targets. ("Cut 'actually'.")
4.  **The Directive:** Issues a specific System Prompt (`[CUTTER]`, `[GROUNDER]`) for the LLM to execute.

### 4. The Output (The Signal)

The system provides immediate, actionable feedback and a visual HUD.

> 📡 [RED][88.5 FM] The Butcher: Cut 'actually'. It's dragging you down.
>
> 🔮 [BLUE] >>> DIRECTIVE [CUTTER]: Drag is 4.5. Use short, declarative sentences.

### 5. The Loop

Correct your text based on the Directive. The system remembers your "Heirlooms" (Heavy Matter) for future use.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v2.6)

### 0. The Resurrection (Heirloom Memory)

-   **Memory with Consequence:** The system collects "Heavy Matter" (Stone, Bone, Iron) from your text and stores them as **Heirlooms**.
-   **The Sacrifice:** If you leave the system for too long (`DECAY` or `FOSSIL` state), it will **burn** a stored Heirloom to generate heat.
    -   *Output:* "I burned 'stone' to stay warm while you were gone."

### 1. Active Directives (Jade Link II)

-   **Command Control:** The `JadeLink` no longer just observes ("Pattern: Stable"). It actively commands the LLM with specific strategies.
    -   **[CUTTER]:** Triggered by Drag/Toxins. *Instruction:* Cut adverbs.
    -   **[GROUNDER]:** Triggered by Entropy. *Instruction:* Force concrete nouns.
    -   **[DRIFTER]:** Triggered by Velocity. *Instruction:* Dream logic authorized.

### 2. Target Locking (Frequency Modulation)

-   **Specific Feedback:** The `RadioTuner` now identifies the *exact word* causing the problem.
    -   *Old:* "Cut the adverbs."
    -   *New:* "Cut 'basically'. It's weak."

### 3. The Vector HUD (Apeirogon Vis)

-   **Raw Mathematics:** The Dashboard now exposes the raw 5-Dimensional Vectors, allowing you to see the "Shape" of your writing.
    -   **VEL (Velocity):** Kinetic Ratio.
    -   **TEX (Texture):** Matter Density.
    -   **ENT (Entropy):** Abstraction Level.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The BoneConfig (The Internal Pantry)

The hardcoded DNA. Contains 300+ words of Heavy Matter, Aerobic Matter, and Toxins, optimized as $O(1)$ lookups.

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (The Heart)

Powered by the **Single-Pass Loop**. It aggregates Kinetic Ratio, Spatial Density, Vectors, and Toxin Scores in one instantaneous sweep.

### 2. The Radio Tuner (Personality)

Now receives specific `toxin_hits` from the engine to enable **Target Locking**.
-   **Clarence:** Hunts Drag.
-   **Eloise:** Hunts Entropy.
-   **Yaga:** Hunts Sycophancy.

### 3. The Jade Link (The Director)

Generates the `>>> DIRECTIVE` string. This is the **System Prompt Generator** that tells the LLM how to behave based on the current physics.

### 4. BoneMemory (The Soul)

The persistence layer. Tracks **ATP** (Creative Energy), **Time Deltas**, and the **Heirloom Registry** (Sacrificial Memory).

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is running:

1.  **Input:** Paste your draft.
2.  **Read:** Check the **Radio** (for specific critiques) and **Directive** (for strategy).
3.  **Respect Time:** If you leave, be prepared to lose a memory.
