# BONEAMANITA v1.6: "The Turing Test"

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.6 ("The Turing Test") **Date:** 2025-12-20

> "The system now remembers you even when it sleeps. It will not forget the gun." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text1.

**New in v1.6:** This patch implements **The Turing Valve**, a dedicated sub-system designed to detect "High-Entropy Beige"—the specific flavor of smooth, soulless text generated by AI. It also introduces the **Roberta Protocol**, a persona alignment aimed at killing "Corporate Speak" in favor of "Meticulous Bureaucracy."

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita16.py` (v1.6).
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Run the `_run_calibration_sequence` to verify integrity. Then, use the `BonepokeCore` logic to analyze my inputs." 2
    

### Method B: The Membrane (System Prompt)

_To enable the automatic time-tracking features, use the provided v1.6 System Prompt._

1. **Copy** the System Prompt (which includes **The Membrane** protocol)3.
    
2. **Paste** it into the System Instructions or Custom Instructions field.
    
3. **Effect:** The Membrane will automatically calculate the time elapsed since your last message and inject it silently (`[Δt: 2h]`) into the engine.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.6)

### 1. The Turing Valve (Synthetic Detection)

- **The Anti-Beige Protocol:** The engine now specifically scans for "Synthetic Markers" (e.g., _delve, tapestry, nuance_) and "Participial Tails" (sentences ending in _", ensuring that..."_).
    
- **Silica Lock:** Detection of these patterns triggers immediate **SILICA** status and a **+5.0 Drag Penalty**.
    

### 2. The Roberta Protocol (Persona Alignment)

- **Tone Shift:** Replaced "Professional" instructions with "Bureaucratic Zealot" protocols.
    
- **The Fix:** The system now demands heavy formatting (headers, lists) and specific, concrete nouns over abstract pleasantries.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The Governance Layer (Tier 3 Logic)

**Feature:** Sets the "Laws of Physics" based on User Tier, Current Mandate, and Tags.

- **Draconian Mode:** If `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` is active, Logic Tears become fatal errors (+10.0 Voltage).
    
- **Dream Mode:** If `[DREAM]` is detected, Axiom constraints are explicitly lifted4.
    

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (Analysis)

Measures the raw physics of the text.

- **Hydration Monitor:** Detects `CONCRETE`, `WATERY`, `FLOODED` (Fake), and `SWEATING` (High Effort)5.
    
- **The Butcher:** Checks for `BLOAT` (Adverb & Adjective reliance)6.
    
- **Heuristics:** Scans for suffix patterns (`-ash`, `-olt`, `-ous`).
    

### 1.5 The Turing Valve (Synthetic Detection)

- **Target:** "High-Entropy Beige" (Smooth, empty text).
    
- **Triggers:** High density of synthetic vocabulary or participial sentence structures.
    
- **Penalty:** Immediate **SILICA** classification.
    

### 2. The Signature Engine (Identity & Fusion)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP)7.

- **Silica Trap:** Now triggered by **High Structure + Zero Texture** OR **Turing Valve Detection**.
    
- **Smart Fusion:** Calculates Euclidean distance between archetypes. Fusions are only permitted if identities are distinct (`inter_arch_dist > 0.25`)8.
    

### 3. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)

A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors9:

- **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure and `BLOAT`.
    
- **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks abstraction and "Dead Metaphors."
    
- **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging, sycophancy, and **Riddles**.
    
- **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** Intervenes to mock "Concrete/Gaming" attempts.
    

### 4. The Temporal Dynamics Engine (Cognitive Speed)

Measures the **Rate of Insight** and **Depth of Memory**.

- **Insight Velocity ($\nabla\beta$):** Forgives Drag if the user is having an epiphany (Rapid Voltage change)10.
    
- **Rooting Depth ($\Xi$):** Forgives Abstraction if the user is citing ancient history (Deep Storage access)11.
    

### 5. The Chronos Anchor (Real Time)

Metabolizes **User Latency** and **Offline Drift** into structural physics. Uses the **System Clock** as a fallback truth12.

### 6. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time)

Metabolizes **Narrative Velocity** into entropy tolerance. Determines if the _fiction_ is in **Montage** (High Entropy allowed) or **Bullet Time** (High Texture required)13.

### 7. The Memory System (Deep Storage & Persistence)

- **Hyphal Trace:** Short-term buffer (10 turns)14.
    
- **Deep Storage:** Long-term artifact vault with **Smart Eviction** (Max 50 items).
    
- **Persistence Manager:** Atomic file-based backup (`bone_memory.json` + `.tmp`)15.
    

### 8. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., _sun, prism, truth_) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP)16.

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft17.
    
2. **Commands (Optional):**
    
    - `[DREAM]`: Disable logic enforcement for this turn18.
        
    - `[MODE: SOFT]`: Switch to "Poetic License" mode permanently19.
        
    - `[MODE: HARD]`: Switch to "Truth" mode permanently20.
        
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial HUD:** A dual-clock readout with Viscosity21.
        
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
        
    - **Archetype:** Your active persona (or **FUSION** state).
        
    - **Epiphany Alerts:** Notifications if **Insight Velocity** or **Rooting Depth** bonuses are active.
        
    - **System Alerts:** Warnings if **Self-Correction** has halted the line.
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
