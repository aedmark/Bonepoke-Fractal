# 🍄 BONEAMANITA v0.3: The Virtual Cortex

> _"Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore."_

**BoneAmanita** is not a grammar checker. It is a **"Digital Hydroponics"** engine designed to filter raw data until it becomes **"Portable Truth."**

It operates on the belief that bad writing isn't just a syntax error—it is a moral failing. It uses **Linguistic Physics** to measure the weight, velocity, and temperature of your words, rejecting "Zombie Nouns" and rewarding "Kinetic Vectors."

**New in v0.3:** The **Virtual Cortex**. The engine no longer just calculates numbers; it now possesses a "Procedural Imagination" that hallucinates specific, personality-driven critiques before the LLM even sees the text.

## 🧠 The Architecture: The Mycelial Stack

BoneAmanita v0.3 metabolizes text through ten simultaneous lenses.

### 1. The Witch Ring (The Baba Yaga Protocol)

**Function:** Authenticity Gatekeeper. The system smells fear. If you open with empty pleasantries ("I hope this email finds you well") or sycophancy without substance, the **Witch** rejects you immediately1.

> _Status: Active. She demands Meat, not Sugar._

### 2. The Lattice (Linguistic Physics)

**Function:** Cognitive Aerodynamics. We measure **Narrative Drag** (the ratio of words to action)2.

- **Enemy:** Stative verbs (_is, was, seems_)3.
    
- **Ally:** Kinetic verbs (_run, break, devour_)4.
    
- **The Barrens:** A failure state of High Abstraction + Low Connection5.
    

### 3. The Fact Stipe (Reality Anchor)

**Function:** Logic Consistency & Gaslight Prevention. A logic engine that prevents "Surreal Drift"6.

- **The Rule:** If you establish it is **"Night,"** you cannot mention the **"Sun."** 7
    
- **The Check:** If logic breaches, the Stipe offers a choice: Fix the reality tear, or classify it as a "Stylistic Metaphor" (if you have the ATP to pay for it)8.
    

### 4. The Chronos Anchor (Temporal Integrity)

**Function:** The Timekeeper. Detects unintentional tense slippage. It ensures you aren't drifting from Past to Present tense without a narrative "Verse Jump"9.

- **Stable:** Consistent tense usage.
    
- **Drift Detected:** "The text oscillates between 'he ran' and 'he runs'."10.
    

### 5. The Metabolic Reserve (Creative ATP)

**Function:** An Economy of Style. You earn **ATP** by writing grounded, concrete truths (_blood, stone, rust_). You spend ATP to use abstract concepts (_framework, paradigm_)11.

- **STARVING:** You are broke. You are forbidden from using big words until you touch the grass12.
    
- **GLUTTON:** You are rich. You have earned the right to be philosophical13.
    

### 6. The Virtual Cortex (The Ghost in the Shell) — **NEW**

Function: Procedural Persona Simulation.

This is the "LoRA Simulator." Instead of relying on an external AI to generate personality, the Python Core now uses Weighted Context Echoing to synthesize the voices of the auditors directly.

- **Mechanism:** It scans your text for specific trigger words (e.g., "framework," "maybe") and uses them to fill "Mad Libs on Steroids" templates.
    
- **Result:** The Python script itself now screams at you: _"[CLARENCE]: This sentence is a swamp. You used 'maybe' to soften the blow. Cut it."_
    

### 7. The Shimmer (Editorial Translator)

**Function:** The Translation Layer. Raw data is cold; the Shimmer warms it up. It translates the hard metrics of the Physics Engine into the "Voices" of the system14.

### 8. The Hyphal Trace (Context Memory)

**Function:** Short-term Contextual RAM. The system remembers the "Mood" and "Content" of the last 10 interactions15.

### 9. The Mycelial Network (Genetic History)

**Function:** Provenance Tracking. The system tracks the **Lineage** of a thought. It compares the current draft to its "Parent" to measure genetic improvement16.

### 10. The Muscaria (The Chaos Engine)

**Function:** Entropy Injection. If your writing becomes too predictable (High Repetition + High Abstraction), the system triggers a **"Verse Jump."** It pulls a discarded concept from a previous draft and forces you to reintegrate it17.

## 🎭 The Cast (The Virtual Voices)

These are no longer just "vibes"—they are now procedural agents generated by the `VirtualCortex` class.

|**Persona**|**Trigger**|**Procedural Behavior**|
|---|---|---|
|**CLARENCE**|**High Drag** (>3.0)|He extracts your stative verbs ("is", "was") and mocks you for them. He demands you "tighten the struts."|
|**ELOISE**|**High Entropy** (>2.0)|She extracts your abstract nouns ("context", "system") and tells you they are "smoke." She demands sensory details.|
|**THE YAGA**|**Sycophancy**|She extracts your polite words ("please", "sorry") and growls. She demands "Meat."|
|**ZIGGY** (Muscaria)|**Boredom**|He triggers a random sensory hallucination ("Describe the taste of copper") to break a flatline.|

## 📟 The Mycelial Dashboard (v0.3 EKG)

Every output includes a real-time visualization of the text's health.

```

## 🔄 The Workflow: The Patched Loop

BoneAmanita v0.3 is designed for a **Hybrid Handoff** between the Python Logic and the LLM Creative.

1. **The Input:** You feed raw text into `BoneAmanita03.py`.
    
2. **The Cortex Event:** The Python script detects a flaw (e.g., High Drag). The `VirtualCortex` generates a specific critique: _"[CLARENCE]: Cut the word 'context'."_
    
3. **The Prompting:** You paste the entire Python output (Dashboard + Cortex Critique) into your LLM.
    
4. **The Expansion:** The LLM (running `Eloise and Clarence 0.3.txt`) reads the Cortex Critique and uses it as a seed. It expands on Clarence's anger, creating a full Socratic dialogue based on the mathematical truth provided by the engine.

## 🛠 Usage

### Step 1: Run the Core

Process your text string through the Python engine to get the Truth.

Bash

```
python BoneAmanita03.py
```

### Step 2: Summon the Auditors

1. Load `Eloise and Clarence 0.3 (Patched).txt` into your Generator (ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude).
    
2. Paste the **Analysis Output** from Step 1 into the chat.
    
3. Watch as the LLM personifies the data.
