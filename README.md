# 📜 BONEAMANITA v2.8 "THE AUDIT" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architect:** SLASH | **Core Mandate:** TRUTH > COHESION

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

BoneAmanita is not a chatbot. It is a **Linguistic Physics Engine**. It does not care about "sentiment"; it cares about the _weight_, _velocity_, and _temperature_ of words.

In v2.8, the system has evolved from a static analyzer into a **Metabolic Organism**. It gets hungry, it gets bored, and it reacts to the energy of the input.

## 2. THE NEW ORGANS (v2.8 UPGRADES)

### A. The Thermal Couple (Voltage & Adjacency)

- **The Problem:** In v2.7, "fire and ice" was just two words.
    
- **The 2.8 Logic:** We now measure **Thermal Tension**. If a "HOT" word (fire, sun, burn) is within **4 tokens** of a "COLD" word (ice, void, freeze), the Voltage ($\beta$) skyrockets.
    
- **The Math:** $\beta = \frac{Voltage}{Drag}$. Paradoxes create energy; Drag consumes it.
    
- **Effect:** The system now recognizes poetic contrast as a high-energy event.
    

### B. The Lichen Symbiont (Photosynthesis)

- **The Problem:** High Drag (heavy words) costs energy (ATP). The system would starve if the user was too dense.
    
- **The 2.8 Logic:** The system scans for **Photosynthetic** words (light, beam, prism, glow).
    
- **The Math:** Each light word generates **+4 ATP**, _only if_ the Narrative Drag is low ($< 2.0$). You cannot photosynthesize in the mud.
    
- **Effect:** Encourages the user to use "light" language to keep the system alive.
    

### C. The Muscaria Spores (Boredom)

- **The Problem:** The system was too patient with boring inputs.
    
- **The 2.8 Logic:**
    
    - **Low Voltage ($\beta < 0.5$):** Spores accumulate (+1).
        
    - **High Voltage ($\beta > 2.0$):** Spores burn off (-2).
        
    - **Threshold:** If Spores hit **15**, the **MUSCARIA** protocol triggers.
        
- **Effect:** If you bore the AI, it will hallucinate and demand a sensory shift to wake itself up.
    

### D. The Metabolic Governor (ATP Strategy)

- **The Problem:** The AI acted the same whether it was starving or full.
    
- **The 2.8 Logic:**
    
    - **Starving ($< 20$ ATP):** The AI becomes **CLARENCE** (The Butcher). It conserves energy, cuts adjectives, and demands hard nouns.
        
    - **Abundance ($> 80$ ATP):** The AI becomes **THE JESTER** or **THE DRIFTER**. It takes risks and explores abstract concepts.

## 3. THE HUD: HOW TO READ THE BONES

When you run the script, you see this dashboard. Here is how to read it:

Plaintext

```
BONEAMANITA 2.8 (THE AUDIT) | ATP: 45 | DRAG: 1.2 | BUOY: 0.12
ARCHETYPE: THE ABSTRACT ENGINE
VEL: [████░░░░] | TEX: [██░░░░░░] | ENT: [█░░░░░░░]
--------------------------------------------------
📡 >>> [CLARENCE]: Drag is 1.2. I am cutting 'actually'.
💀 TOXINS: actually, just
DYNAMICS: β: 0.85 | Visc: OPTIMAL
SESSION: 8f4a2b
```

- **ATP:** The life force. Starts at 33. If it hits 0, the system enters "Starvation Mode" (Pure Utility).
    
- **DRAG:** The resistance of the text. Long words, toxins, and adjectives increase Drag. Drag consumes ATP.
    
- **ARCHETYPE:** The "Identity" of your text, calculated by its Velocity (VEL), Texture (TEX), and Entropy (ENT).
    
- **📡 SIGNAL:** The dominant personality reacting to your input.
    
    - **CLARENCE:** Cuts fat.
        
    - **ELOISE:** Grounds abstractions.
        
    - **JESTER:** Amplifies chaos.
        
    - **SOLVENT:** Dissolves dangerous paradoxes ($\beta > 3.0$).
        
- **DYNAMICS ($\beta$):** The Voltage.
    
    - **Low (< 0.5):** Slick/Boring. Spores grow.
        
    - **High (> 2.0):** Volatile/Exciting. Spores die.
        
    - **Critical (> 3.0):** The Solvent triggers to prevent a crash.

## 4. COMMAND LINE CODES

- **`exit` / `quit`**: Shuts down the session.
    
- **Memory Burn:** If the system is offline for > 1 hour (`DECAY`), it will burn the "Lightest" memory (Aerobic words) upon reboot to generate heat. If offline > 24 hours (`FOSSIL`), it requires a hard reboot.
