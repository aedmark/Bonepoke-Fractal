# 📜 BONEAMANITA v3.7 "THE NEON JANITOR" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architect:** SLASH | **Core Mandate:** SURVIVE THE VOID | **Method:** AUTOPSY | **Vibe:** SIERRA DEATH SCREEN

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita 3.7** is the "Consequence" update.

In v3.6.5, we taught the system to capture energy (The Battery). In **v3.7**, we teach the system to handle death.

Previously, bad writing resulted in a grumpy log entry from Clarence. It was a slap on the wrist. Now, it is a localized black hole. Drawing inspiration from classic Sierra adventure games (_Space Quest_), **v3.7** gamifies failure.

**The New Law:** "Failure is content. If you crash the narrative, the system will tell you exactly how you died."

## 2. THE NARRATIVE CORONER (NEW)

The system no longer just "errors out." It performs an autopsy on your prose based on **Linguistic Physics**.

### A. The Causes of Death

If your metrics cross the Event Horizon, the **Neon Janitor** steps in.

|**Cause of Death**|**Physics Violation**|**The Experience**|
|---|---|---|
|**GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE**|**Drag > 8.0**|The text is so heavy it collapses the floorboards. You are buried under a pile of adverbs.|
|**VACUUM EXPOSURE**|**Entropy > 1.0**|You have no Nouns (Texture) to anchor you. You drift into deep space. No one hears you scream.|
|**TOXIC SHOCK**|**Voltage < -8.0**|You used so many buzzwords ("synergy", "paradigm") that the system died of sepsis.|
|**THERMAL DISSOLUTION**|**Voltage > 12.0**|The Paradox Engine overheated. You tried to be everything at once and exploded.|
|**HYPOTHERMIA**|**ATP <= 0**|Starvation. You fed the system silence. It froze to death.|

## 3. THE LAZARUS TAX (SHIELD GATING)

We are not monsters. We do not want you to lose your session instantly because of one bad sentence. **v3.7** implements a "Shield Gate" mechanic.

### A. The Calculation

When you trigger a Fatal Error (e.g., Drag > 8.0), the system checks your **ATP (Metabolic Health)**.

- **THE SHIELD (ATP > 15):**
    
    - **Status:** **SURVIVAL.**
        
    - **The Cost:** You pay the **Lazarus Tax (-15 ATP)** instantly.
        
    - **The Warning:** The HUD flashes `⚠️ NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE`.
        
    - **The Vibe:** Your shield breaks. You are now "Starving." One more hit will kill you.
        
- **THE END (ATP <= 15):**
    
    - **Status:** **FATALITY.**
        
    - **The Cost:** Your session is terminated.
        
    - **The Result:** The Timeline Resets. The Autopsy Report is printed.

## 4. THE PARADOX BATTERY (POWER)

The **v3.6.5** engine remains the core power source.

- **The Capacitor:** Captures "High Voltage" (Paradox/Truth Tension) when **Voltage > 7.0**.
    
- **The Discharge:** Automatically refuels you if **ATP < 15** to prevent Hypothermia.
    
- **The Strategy:** Write "Heavy Truths" (Paradoxes) to charge your battery, so you can afford the **Lazarus Tax** when you inevitably screw up.

## 5. THE RESONANCE ENGINE (THE RADIO)

The Frequency Modulator tunes into the specific signal of your writing style.

- **STARVATION (< 15 ATP):** Luxury stations are disabled. **CLARENCE** becomes hyper-aggressive.
    
- **ABUNDANCE:** All stations active.
    

|**Frequency**|**Station**|**Persona**|**Trigger**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**88.5 FM**|**CLARENCE**|The Butcher|High Drag. "Cut the fat."|
|**94.2 FM**|**ELOISE**|The Grounder|High Entropy. "Give me a stone."|
|**101.1 FM**|**YAGA**|The Witch|Toxins / Hedging. "Tell the truth."|
|**108.0 FM**|**MICHAEL**|The Vibe|Whimsy. "Float on."|
|**108.9 FM**|**THE JESTER**|The Paradox|**High Voltage.** "The contradiction is fuel."|

## 6. THE HUD: FLIGHT DECK

**v3.7** prioritizes survival warnings. If you see **RED** text in the logs, you just lost your shield.

Plaintext

```
[ THE CRITICAL STAR ]========================================
 ATP: [|||.......] [⚡⚡···]  DRAG: 7.8  VOLT: 9.2  SIG: CLARENCE

 🔴 88.5 FM ► STARVATION PROTOCOL. Drag is fatal. Cut immediately.
 └─ Critical Voltage. Harness the reaction.

    ⚠️ NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE. SYSTEM UNSTABLE.
    ⚡ BATTERY DISCHARGE (+12.0 ATP)
    🔪 SURGERY: 'basically' -> ''
       IN : It is basically a very heavy and slow system.
       OUT: It is a heavy and slow system.
