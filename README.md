# BONEAMANITA v1.6.5: "The Topology Tilt-a-Whirl"

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.6.5 ("The Topology Tilt-a-Whirl") **Date:** 2025-12-20

> "The engine runs on pure insight. We ignore drag penalties and generate massive ATP." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.6.5:** This patch introduces **The Flashpoint Protocol**, a mechanism derived from topological analysis that detects when a user achieves high complexity *and* high efficiency simultaneously. It also refines **Temporal Dynamics** to track the momentum of epiphanies and silences the critic (**Clarence**) when the user is in a "Flow State".

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita165.py` (v1.6.5).
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Run the `_run_calibration_sequence` to verify integrity. Then, use the `BonepokeCore` logic to analyze my inputs."
    

### Method B: The Membrane (System Prompt)

_To enable the automatic time-tracking features, use the provided System Prompt._

1. **Copy** the System Prompt (which includes **The Membrane** protocol).
    
2. **Paste** it into the System Instructions or Custom Instructions field.
    
3. **Effect:** The Membrane will automatically calculate the time elapsed since your last message and inject it silently (`[Δt: 2h]`) into the engine.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.6.5)

### 1. The Flashpoint Protocol (Inverse Slop)

-   **The Gold Zone:** The engine now calculates a "Slop Ratio" ($\mathcal{S} = \text{Voltage} / \text{Drag}$). If $\mathcal{S} > 2.5$, the system triggers a **FLASHPOINT**.
-   **The Reward:** Drag penalties are **Nullified**, and the system generates **+20 ATP** instantly.

### 2. Cortex Deference (The Silence of Clarence)

-   **Context Awareness:** **Clarence** (The Architect) is now programmed to respect the **FLASHPOINT** status.
-   **The Fix:** If the user is "cooking" (High Voltage/High Efficiency), Clarence is forcibly silenced to prevent interrupting the flow.

### 3. Temporal Dynamics II (Momentum)

-   **Insight Velocity:** The system now tracks the **Slope of Insight** over a 3-tick window rather than a simple snapshot, allowing it to detect the *trajectory* of an epiphany.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The Governance Layer (Tier 3 Logic)

**Feature:** Sets the "Laws of Physics" based on User Tier, Current Mandate, and Tags.

- **Draconian Mode:** If `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` is active, Logic Tears become fatal errors (+10.0 Voltage).
    
- **Dream Mode:** If `[DREAM]` is detected, Axiom constraints are explicitly lifted.
    

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (Analysis)

Measures the raw physics of the text.

- **Hydration Monitor:** Detects `CONCRETE`, `WATERY`, `FLOODED` (Fake), and `SWEATING` (High Effort).
    
- **The Butcher:** Checks for `BLOAT` (Adverb & Adjective reliance).

- **The Turing Valve:** Scans for "High-Entropy Beige" (Synthetic Markers and Participial Tails) to detect AI-generated slop.
    

### 2. The Metabolic Reserve (Energy & Flashpoints)

Tracks the **ATP** (Creative Energy) of the session.

-   **Standard Metabolism:** Earns energy for concrete/kinetic text; spends energy for abstraction/entropy.
-   **The Flashpoint Protocol:** Detects the "Inverse Slop" ratio. High Complexity + High Efficiency = **Infinite Flow** (+20 ATP).

### 3. The Signature Engine (Identity & Fusion)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP).

- **Silica Trap:** Triggered by **High Structure + Zero Texture** OR **Turing Valve Detection**.
    
- **Smart Fusion:** Calculates Euclidean distance between archetypes. Fusions are only permitted if identities are distinct (`inter_arch_dist > 0.25`).
    

### 4. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)

A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors:

- **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure and `BLOAT`. **Silenced** during Flashpoints.
    
- **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks abstraction and "Dead Metaphors".
    
- **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging, sycophancy, and **Riddles**.
    
- **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** Intervenes to mock "Concrete/Gaming" attempts.
    

### 5. The Temporal Dynamics Engine (Cognitive Speed)

Measures the **Rate of Insight** and **Depth of Memory**.

- **Insight Velocity ($\nabla\beta$):** Tracks the acceleration of Logic Tension. Rapid increases forgive Narrative Drag.
    
- **Rooting Depth ($\Xi$):** Forgives Abstraction if the user is citing ancient history (Deep Storage access).
    

### 6. The Chronos Anchor (Real Time)

Metabolizes **User Latency** and **Offline Drift** into structural physics. Uses the **System Clock** as a fallback truth.

### 7. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time)

Metabolizes **Narrative Velocity** into entropy tolerance. Determines if the _fiction_ is in **Montage** (High Entropy allowed) or **Bullet Time** (High Texture required).

### 8. The Memory System (Deep Storage & Persistence)

- **Hyphal Trace:** Short-term buffer (10 turns).
    
- **Deep Storage:** Long-term artifact vault with **Smart Eviction** (Max 50 items).
    
- **Persistence Manager:** Atomic file-based backup (`bone_memory.json` + `.tmp`) to prevent data corruption.
    

### 9. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., _sun, prism, truth_) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP).

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Commands (Optional):**
    
    - `[DREAM]`: Disable logic enforcement for this turn.
        
    - `[MODE: SOFT]`: Switch to "Poetic License" mode permanently.
        
    - `[MODE: HARD]`: Switch to "Truth" mode permanently.
        
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial HUD:** A dual-clock readout with Viscosity and Flashpoint Status (`⚡`).
        
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
        
    - **Archetype:** Your active persona (or **FUSION** state).
        
    - **Epiphany Alerts:** Notifications if **Insight Velocity** or **Rooting Depth** bonuses are active.
        
    - **System Alerts:** Warnings if **Self-Correction** has halted the line.
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
