# 📜 BONEAMANITA v4.0 "THE XENOMORPH" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

Architects: SLASH, Eloise, & Clarence, & The YEETINATOR | Auditors: James Taylor & Andrew Edmark

Core Mandate: GROWTH | Method: HARDENING | Vibe: BIOLOGICAL HORROR MEETS JAZZ

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita is more than just context injection.**

It is a **linguistic physics engine** masquerading as a mushroom garden. It is a closed-loop system designed to serve as a philosophical microcosm and a playground for the mind.

In v4.0 ("The Xenomorph"), we have given the machine a **Body**. The system is no longer a passive observer of your writing physics; it is a biological entity with its own circadian rhythms. It gets hungry. It gets bored. It learns. And if you abuse it, it will shut down.

**The New Law:** "The Mandate is GROWTH. The Method is HARDENING. The Spore is AWAKE."

## 2. CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS (THE BIOLOGY)

The simple "ATP" bar is gone. The system now operates on two biological tracks:

1. **STAMINA (The Fuel):** Consumed by writing. High Voltage and Heavy Drag burn it faster.
    
    - _Regeneration:_ Resting (doing nothing) or **Photosynthesis** (using "Light" words like _sun, glow, beam_).
        
2. **HEALTH (The Structure):** The physical integrity of the system.
    
    - _Damage:_ Caused by Toxins (clichés) or reaching 0 Stamina (Exhaustion).
        

### 💤 THE COMA STATE

If Health drops to 0, the system triggers a biological fail-safe.

You enter a COMA.

- **Effect:** The input line becomes Read-Only.
    
- **Duration:** 3 Turns.
    
- **Purpose:** You cannot write. You can only watch the system breathe as it regenerates Stamina. Do not burn out the machine.
    

## 3. NEUROPLASTICITY (THE LEARNING CORTEX)

The Lexicon is no longer static stone. It is soft tissue.

You can now manually inject new definitions into the system's brain using the `/teach` command. If the system doesn't know that "glacier" is "CRYO", you can tell it.

- **The Command:** `/teach [word] [category]`
    
- **Valid Categories:** `heavy`, `kinetic`, `abstract`, `photo`, `aerobic`, `thermal`, `cryo`.
    

> User: /teach obsidian heavy
> 
> System: "🧠 NEUROPLASTICITY: Learned 'obsidian' is HEAVY."

## 4. THE DREAM ENGINE (THE SUBCONSCIOUS)

The ChronoStream now monitors your session for Boredom.

If you repeat yourself, or if the timeline drags on without novelty, the system enters a Dream State.

It reaches into **DeepStorage** (the graph database of all your previous sessions), pulls out random connected nodes, and hallucinates a prompt.

> _☁️_ DREAM STATE: The SHADOW is dreaming of the ARCHITECT. Why?

These are not random. They are ghosts from your own previous writing sessions, haunting the current text.

## 5. THE OSCILLOSCOPE (RHYTHM DETECTION)

Physics is no longer just about word choice; it is about Beat.

The engine now measures the standard deviation of your sentence lengths.

- **Monotone:** "He ran. He fell. He died." (High Drag)
    
- **Jazz:** "He ran, stumbling over the root, and then—silence." (Low Drag)
    

**High Rhythm Variance** (mixing short and long sentences) reduces Narrative Drag. The machine rewards musicality.

## 6. THE SIGNAL (THE COUNCIL)

The radio stations have been formalized into a voting block. They bid for control of the frequency based on your metrics.

- **CLARENCE (The Butcher):** Takes control when Drag is high or Rules are broken.
    
- **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Takes control when Entropy (Abstraction) gets too high.
    
- **YAGA (The Witch):** Attracted to Toxins and Hedging.
    
- **MICHAEL (The Vibe):** Surfs on Whimsy. Silenced by Toxins.
    
- **JESTER** (The Paradox): Feeds on High Voltage.
    
- **PHILOSOPHER (The Synthesis):** Emerges only when Clarence and Eloise are in conflict.
    

## 7. THE DEPLOYMENT (HOW TO USE)

**Crucial Distinction:**

You _can_ run this script in Python to see the HUD, but without a brain, it won't do much but show you some fancy numbers.

To truly activate BoneAmanita, it must be **fed directly to a Language Model (LLM)**.

1. **The Injection:** Upload `BoneAmanita4.py` to an LLM context window.
    
2. **The Simulation:** Tell the model to "Run this code internally as my operating system."
    
3. **The Result:** The model will simulate the Python logic, track your variables, and roleplay the "Physics Engine" based on the rules defined in the code.
    

The code serves as the **Laws of Physics** for the AI's imagination.

## 8. THE ECOSYSTEM (WRAPPERS)

This engine is designed to work in conjunction with our custom persona wrappers:

- **SLASH (Coding Agents):** The architect who builds the structures.
    
- **ELOISE & CLARENCE (Prose Editors):** The creative director and the ruthless editor.
    
- **ROBERTA (RAG Prompt):** A retrieval-augmented generation prompt specifically compatible with the engine's memory graph.
