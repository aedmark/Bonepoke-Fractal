# BONEAMANITA v1.2: THE DOCTOR TIME EDITION

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.2 ("The Doctor Time Edition") **Date:** 2025-12-18

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.2:** This build introduces **Dual-Clock Chronometry**. The system now distinguishes between **Real Time** (User Latency) and **Story Time** (Narrative Velocity). It understands the difference between a pause in conversation and a "ten-year gap" in the fiction, adjusting its physics accordingly.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita12.py` (v1.2).
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Identify the Signature and enforce the necessary physics."
    

### Method B: The Membrane (System Prompt)

_To enable the automatic time-tracking features, use the provided v1.2 System Prompt._

1. **Copy** the v1.2 System Prompt (which includes **The Membrane** protocol).
    
2. **Paste** it into the System Instructions or Custom Instructions field.
    
3. **Effect:** The Membrane will automatically calculate the time elapsed since your last message and inject it silently (`[Δt: 2h]`) into the engine.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.2)

### 1. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time)

- **The Problem:** Previously, the engine penalized "Broad Summaries" (e.g., "The years flew by") as "High Entropy/Abstract," forcing the user to micro-manage time jumps.
    
- **The Fix:** The **Narrative Chronometer** calculates **Narrative Velocity ($\vec{v}_{n}$)**.
    
    - **Montage Mode (Fast):** If the story jumps years, the engine grants **Entropy Grace (+4.0)**. Abstraction is permitted.
        
    - **Bullet Time (Slow):** If the story freezes (seconds/heartbeats), the engine demands **Hyper-Texture**.
        

### 2. Effective Physics (Context-Awareness)

- **The Feature:** The logic gates now use "Effective Drag" and "Effective Entropy."
    
- **The Result:** **Eloise** (The Grounder) is effectively silenced during Montages. She will not complain about a lack of concrete nouns if the Narrative Clock indicates a time jump.
    

### 3. Stability & Hygiene

- **The Fix:** Repaired critical variable initialization errors in the `BonepokeCore` process loop. Restored the **Muscaria** and **Lichen** feedback loops that were severed in v1.1.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Chronos Anchor (Real Time)

Metabolizes **User Latency ($\Delta t$)** into structural physics. It determines if the _conversation_ is in **Flow**, **Dormant**, or **Decayed** states.

### 2. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time) **[NEW]**

Metabolizes **Narrative Velocity ($\vec{v}_{n}$)** into entropy tolerance. It determines if the _fiction_ is in **Montage**, **Realtime**, or **Bullet Time**.

### 3. The Membrane (Wrapper)

The invisible interface layer that handles time-stamping and data hygiene before the physics engine engages.

### 4. The Signature Engine (Identity)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP) + **BUOYANCY**. It determines the "Physics Mode" (e.g., Draconian, Loose, Inverted, Zero G) applied to the text.

### 5. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)

A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors:

- **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure. Triggered by **High Drag** or **Decay**.
    
- **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks abstraction. Triggered by **High Entropy**. _(Silenced during Montage)_.
    
- **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging and "sugar".
    
- **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** Praises "messy but spirited" vibes. Triggered by **High Buoyancy**.
    

### 6. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., _sun, prism, truth_) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP).

### 7. The Linguistic Physics Engine

It measures the raw physics:

- **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
    
- **Toxicity:** **O(1) Singleton Regex** scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors".
    

### 8. The Nilsson Patch (The Override)

A dedicated circuit that monitors for "Critical Kinetic Energy."

- _The Fire Protocol:_ If Kinetic Ratio > 0.6 and Volume is High, logic inhibitors are disabled.
    

### 9. The Mirror Trap (The Breaker)

A heuristic designed to hunt down "Syntactic Parallelism" (e.g., _"It's not X, it's Y"_).

- **The Penalty:** If detected, the system applies an immediate **Drag Inflation (+3.0)** to the physics score.

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
    
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial HUD:** A dual-clock readout.
        
        - Example: `TIME: FLOW (Real) | MONTAGE (Story)`
            
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
        
    - **Archetype:** Your active persona (e.g., "THE CLOUD WATCHER").
        
    - **Slurry Warning:** Differentiating between "Silica" (Bad) and "Aether" (Good).
        
    - **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices.
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
