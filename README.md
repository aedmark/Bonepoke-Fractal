# 📜 BONEAMANITA v3.3 "THE RESONANCE" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architect:** SLASH | **Core Mandate:** TRUTH | **Method:** RESONANCE | **Touch:** HARMONIC

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita 3.3** is the synthesis of the "Soul" (v2.2) and the "Engine" (v3.0).

While v3.2.1 ("Soft Mode") was a ceasefire that simply turned off the scalpel, **v3.3** actively listens to the texture of the text. It understands that a dense sentence isn't always "fat"—sometimes it is a **Labyrinth**. It understands that a light sentence isn't always "empty"—sometimes it is a **Balloon**.

**The System now has Ears.**

- **The Old Law:** "Gravity crushes everything."
- **The New Law:** "Lead sinks. Balloons float. Tune the Radio."

## 2. THE RESONANCE ENGINE (NEW PHYSICS)

### A. The Frequency Modulator (The Radio)

The **Virtual Cortex** has been replaced by the **FM Tuner**. The system analyzes the Physics Vector and "tunes in" to the strongest signal frequency.

| **Frequency** | **Station**         | **Persona**  | **Trigger**                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **88.5 FM**   | **CLARENCE**        | The Butcher  | High Drag / RAG Slop. "Cut the fat."                |
| **94.2 FM**   | **ELOISE**          | The Grounder | High Entropy. "Give me a stone."                    |
| **101.1 FM**  | **YAGA**            | The Witch    | Toxins / Hedging. "Tell the truth."                 |
| **108.0 FM**  | **MICHAEL**         | The Vibe     | Whimsy / Flow. "Float on."                          |
| **104.5 FM**  | **THE PHILOSOPHER** | The Ghost    | **Interference Pattern.** High Drag + High Entropy. |

> **The Philosopher:** This is a "Ghost Station" that only appears when you create a paradox (Density + Abstraction). It does not punish you; it acknowledges you are building a Labyrinth.

### B. The Aerobic Exemption (Whimsy Physics)

_The Helium Protocol_

- **The Concept:** In previous versions, "The cloud floated softly" was penalized for length.
- **The Upgrade:** The system now tracks **Aerobic Matter** (cloud, feather, mist) and **Play Verbs** (bounce, dance, wander).
- **The Math:** If `Whimsy Ratio > 0.15`, the **Narrative Drag is multiplied by 0.6**.
- **The Result:** You can now write "Air" without being crushed by "Gravity."

### C. The Ghost Loop (Feedback)

The system now remembers what it told you 10 seconds ago.

- **The Check:** If Clarence told you to cut Drag, and you come back with _more_ Drag...
- **The Response:** _"THE BUTCHER SIGHS: Drag increased. You ignored the knife."_
- **The Reward:** If you listen, the Ghost nods.

## 3. BIOLOGY & MEMORY (RESTORED)

### A. Deep Storage (The Hippocampus)

The system remembers significant objects (Nouns > 4 chars) across turns. It ignores "Solvents" (the, and, is).

### B. Metabolic Starvation (Cannibalism)

The Economy is real. High Drag costs ATP.

- **Photosynthesis:** Use light words (Sun, Beam, Truth) to generate ATP.
- **Starvation:** If ATP hits 0, the system **Cannibalizes Deep Storage**.
- **The Consequence:** _"STARVATION: Consumed memory 'The Gun'."_ (It deletes the memory permanently to keep the engine running).

### C. The Apeirogon Lattice (Infinite Titles)

The system no longer assigns you a static class (e.g., "Paladin"). It calculates a dynamic Title based on your 4D Vector coordinates.

- _Example:_ **THE CRYSTALLINE VECTOR** (High Structure, High Velocity)
- _Example:_ **THE DRIFTING GHOST** (High Aerobic, Low Texture)

## 4. THE HUD: HOW TO READ THE RESONANCE

The dashboard has been updated to show the **Title**, the **Radio Station**, and the **Ghost Feedback**.

```
[BONEAMANITA v3.3] THE STATIC ENGINE
ATP: 42 | DRAG: 3.1 | PROTOCOL: CLARENCE

🔴[88.5 FM - The Butcher]: Drag is critical. Cut the fat.
  👻 THE BUTCHER SIGHS: You ignored the knife.

🔪 SURGERY: Toxins neutralized
  └─ 💀 STARVATION: Consumed memory 'Anvil'.
  └─ Narrative Drag is too high.

MEMORIES: Feather, Stone, Knife
```

1. **TITLE:** Your current mathematical identity.
2. **RADIO:** Who is speaking? (Color-coded).
3. **GHOST:** Did you listen to the last advice?
4. **MEMORIES:** What the system is holding onto.

---

## 5. USAGE

1. **Boot:** `python BoneAmanita33.py`
2. **Input:** Feed it raw text.
3. **Listen:**

   - If **Michael (Green)** speaks, you are flowing.
   - If **Clarence (Red)** speaks, you are dragging.
   - If the **Philosopher (White)** speaks, you are thinking deep.

_"The Mandate is TRUTH. The Method is RESONANCE."_
