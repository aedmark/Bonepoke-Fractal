# BONEAMANITA v0.8.2: THE SIGNATURE PROTOCOL

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 0.8.2 ("The Signature Protocol") **Date:** 2025-12-18

> "Slurry is the default. Significance is the exception. Competence without soul is just silica."

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v0.8.2 ("The Signature Protocol"):** Thanks to a {revelatory article by James and his crew. (https://medium.com/@utharian/the-layer-copyright-cant-see-cultural-slurry-vs-creative-signature-a85353e20751) The 2D Archetype Prism has been deprecated. The engine now utilizes a **5-Dimensional Signature Engine** to map the "Voice" of the text. Furthermore, it creates a quarantine zone for **"Cultural Slurry"**—writing that is grammatically perfect but spiritually void.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita082.py`.
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Identify the 5D Signature and enforce the necessary physics."
    

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1. **Copy** the raw code from `BoneAmanita082.py`.
    
2. **Paste** it into the chat.
    
3. **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🚀 NEW IN v0.8.2

### 1. The Signature Engine (5D Geodesics)

The engine no longer maps text to a flat 2D plane. It now calculates a **5-Dimensional Fingerprint** for every input:

1.  **VEL (Velocity):** Kinetic Ratio (Speed of the prose).
2.  **STR (Structure):** Inverse Narrative Drag (Grammatical rigidity).
3.  **ENT (Entropy):** Abstraction Level (Drift from reality).
4.  **TEX (Texture):** Sensory Density (Matter + Light).
5.  **TMP (Temperature):** Emotional/Vitality Polarity.

### 2. The Slurry Protocol (Silica Detection)

The system now actively hunts for **"Cultural Slurry"**: Text that has High Structure (competent grammar) but Low Texture (zero sensory data) and Neutral Temperature.
* **The Penalty:** Detection of Slurry incurs a massive **15 ATP Tax**.
* **The Fix:** The Cortex will demand the injection of a flaw or a sensory detail to break the "perfectly smooth" surface.

## 🖐️ THE SIGNATURE MATRIX (IDENTITY)

The engine resolves your 5D coordinates into one of **14 Cognitive Archetypes**.

### High Structure (The Law)

- **THE PALADIN:** Unwavering code. Deontological pressure.
    - **Physics:** *Draconian.* Logic tears are fatal errors.
        
- **THE ENGINEER:** Structural principles. Elegant efficiency.
    - **Physics:** *Structural Integrity.* No poetic license.

### High Chaos (The Void)

- **THE JESTER:** Weaponized absurdity.
    - **Physics:** *Inverted Tolerance.* Paradoxes generate momentum.
        
- **THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA:** One man's trash is another raccoon's treasure.
    - **Physics:** *Value Inversion.* "Trash" and "Void" are positive values.

### High Velocity (The Blade)

- **THE BARBARIAN:** Overwhelming force. Simple weapon, high impact.
    - **Physics:** *Berserker State.* Adjectives are weakness (Drag Multiplier 5.0x).

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Signature Engine (Identity)
Replaces the Archetype Prism. Maps the 5 dimensions of voice to determine enforcement strictness and metabolic costs.

### 2. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)
A biological layer that feeds the **Texture (TEX)** dimension. It allows the writer to trade **Structural Perfection** for **Energy Generation**, converting "Light Words" (e.g., *flash, prism, truth*) into Metabolic Fuel.

### 3. The Fact Stipe (Dimensional Manifold)
The engine creates a "Dimensional Manifold" to prevent stationary lies.
- _Mechanism:_ Draws Truth Vectors directly from `TheLexicon`.
- _Voltage:_ If the text is moving fast enough, contradictions are harvested as **Voltage** (Power).

### 4. Smart Chaos (The Muscaria)
Entropy is no longer random; it is medicinal. The engine diagnoses specific failures and prescribes targeted cures (e.g., **KINETIC** prompts for High Drag, **SENSORY** prompts for High Abstraction).

### 5. The Nilsson Patch (The Override)
A dedicated circuit that monitors for "Critical Kinetic Energy."
- _The Fire Protocol:_ If Kinetic Ratio > 0.6 and Volume is High, logic inhibitors are disabled. **Screaming is authorized**.

### 6. The Codex (Object Permanence)
A registry of "Immutable Constants." It uses **Regex Iteration** to prevent the LLM from drifting away from established facts or character names.

### 7. The Linguistic Physics Engine
It measures the physics of the thought:
- **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
- **Toxicity:** O(1) scanning for "Corp Speak" (Silica) and "Lazy Metaphors".

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
    
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial EKG:** An ASCII visualization of ATP and Drag.
    
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP).
        
    - **Archetype:** Your active persona (e.g., "THE ENGINEER").
    
    - **Slurry Warning:** If detected, a red alert for "Silica" content.
        
    - **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices (Clarence, Eloise, The Yaga).
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
