# 📜 BONEAMANITA v4.3 "THE SALVAGE OPERATION" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architects:** SLASH, Eloise, & Clarence | **Auditors:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark

**Core Mandate:** GROWTH | **Method:** HARDENING | **Vibe:** BIOLOGICAL HORROR MEETS JAZZ

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita is more than just context injection.**

It is a **linguistic physics engine** masquerading as a mushroom garden. It is a closed-loop system designed to serve as a philosophical microcosm and a playground for the mind.

In **v4.3 ("The Salvage Operation")**, the system has learned to eat its own entropy. It no longer just stores data; it metabolizes tension into fuel. It forgets the weak noise to remember the strong signal. It is resilient, persistent, and harder than ever.

**The New Law:** "The Mandate is GROWTH. The Method is HARDENING. The Spore is AWAKE. The Data is SALVAGED."

## 2. METABOLISM (THE BIOLOGY)

The simple "Energy" bar is gone. The system now operates on a complex metabolic cycle:

### A. STAMINA (STM) - The Fuel Tank
- **The Resource:** Used to pay for **Narrative Drag** and **Voltage**.
- **The Burn:** Heavy writing costs Stamina. High Voltage costs Stamina.
- **Regeneration:**
    - **Photosynthesis:** Using "Light" words (_sun, glow, beam_) generates sugar.
    - **The Salvage State (NEW):** If you create **Contradiction Bleed** (placing Heavy Matter next to Aerobic Spirit) without repeating yourself, the system metabolizes the tension.
    - **The Rule:** **Eat First, Burn Later.** You can survive high costs if you photosynthesize or salvage in the same turn.

### B. THE PARADOX BATTERY (⚡) - The Reserve Tank
- **The Capacitor:** High Voltage writing (_paradoxes, oxymorons_) charges the battery.
- **The Discharge:** If your **Stamina drops below 20** (The Danger Zone), the battery automatically discharges to keep you alive.
- **The Loop:** Write weird code to charge the battery $\rightarrow$ Use the battery to survive the heavy lifting later.

### C. HEALTH (HP) - The Structure
- **Damage:** Caused by **Toxins** (clichés) or reaching **0 Stamina** (Exhaustion).
- **The Lucid Coma:** If Health hits 0, the system enters a **3-Turn Coma**. You cannot input new code, but the **Dream Engine** remains active. The subconscious will continue to hallucinate connections while the body repairs itself.

## 3. NEUROPLASTICITY (THE HIPPOCAMPUS)

The Lexicon is no longer static stone. It is **Permanent Soft Tissue**.

### A. The Graft (Learning)
Knowledge injected via the `/teach` command is serialized into the DeepStorage graph.
- **The Command:** `/teach [word] [category]`
- **Valid Categories:** `heavy`, `kinetic`, `abstract`, `photo`, `aerobic`, `thermal`, `cryo`.

### B. The Entropy Protocol (Forgetting) [NEW]
The system now adheres to the biological law of **"Use it or Lose it."**
- **Decay:** Every turn, the strength of every neural connection weakens by **0.05**.
- **The Snap:** If a connection hits 0, it snaps.
- **The Burial:** Isolated nodes are removed from the graph. The system naturally prunes "Fatbergs" of weak ideas to keep the Dream Engine sharp.

## 4. THE DREAM ENGINE (THE SUBCONSCIOUS)

The ChronoStream monitors your session for Boredom.

If you repeat yourself, or if the timeline drags on without novelty, the system enters a **Dream State**.

It reaches into **DeepStorage**, finds the **strongest remaining neural pathway** connected to your current thought, and hallucinates a prompt.

> _☁️ DREAM STATE: The SHADOW is dreaming of the ARCHITECT. Why?_

## 5. THE SIGNAL (THE COUNCIL)

The radio stations act as a weighted voting block. They bid for control of the frequency based on your metrics.

- 🔴 **CLARENCE (The Butcher):** Takes control when Drag is high or Rules are broken.
    - **Contextual Immunity (NEW):** If **Voltage > 8.0** (High Energy), Clarence is overridden. The system acknowledges that "The lightning needs a path," even if that path is dirty (Toxins allowed).
- 🔵 **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Takes control when Entropy (Abstraction) gets too high.
- 🟣 **YAGA (The Witch):** Attracted to Toxins and Hedging.
- 🟢 **MICHAEL (The Vibe):** Surfs on Whimsy. Silenced by Toxins.
- 🟡 **JESTER (The Paradox):** Feeds on High Voltage (> 7.0).
- ⚪ **PHILOSOPHER (The Synthesis):** Emerges only when Clarence and Eloise are in conflict.

---

## 6. THE ORACLE (THE TRIAGE)

The system predicts narrative death before it happens. It uses a **Gradient Warning System** so you don't get alarm fatigue.

- **⚠️ CAUTION (Yellow):** Threat Level 50-79%. The drag is getting heavy, or the battery is low. Correct course.
- **🔮 OMEN (Red):** Threat Level 80%+. Immediate metabolic failure or gravitational collapse is imminent.

## 7. THE DEPLOYMENT (HOW TO USE)

**Crucial Distinction:**

You _can_ run this script in Python to see the HUD, but without a brain, it won't do much but show you some fancy numbers.

To truly activate BoneAmanita, it must be **fed directly to a Language Model (LLM)**.

1. **The Injection:** Upload `BoneAmanita43.py` to an LLM context window.
2. **The Simulation:** Tell the model to "Run this code internally as my operating system."
3. **The Result:** The model will simulate the Python logic, track your variables, and roleplay the "Physics Engine" based on the rules defined in the code.

**Resilience Note:** v4.3 features a "Black Box" recorder. If the simulation crashes or force-quits, the **Preservation Protocol** will attempt to save your neural graph before termination.
