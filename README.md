# 📜 BONEAMANITA v3.6.5 "THE BATTERY PACK" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architect:** SLASH | **Core Mandate:** TRUTH TENSION | **Method:** RESONANCE | **Touch:** HIGH VOLTAGE

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita 3.6.5** is the "High Energy" update.

In previous versions, writing deep, complex, or paradoxical truth was dangerous. High-concept prose carries weight (Mass), creating Narrative Drag. The system would punish you for being too heavy, even if that heaviness was necessary for the truth.

**v3.6.5** introduces **The Paradox Battery** and **Universal Grammar (UG)**.

We realized that contradictory truths generate **Voltage**. Previously, this energy was lost as waste heat. Now, we capture it. If you write a sentence that is physically heavy but electrically charged, the system stockpiles that energy.

**The New Law:** "Genius is a valid fuel source. If you cannot be light, be electric."

## 2. THE PARADOX BATTERY (NEW)

The system now has a secondary power source.

### A. The Capacitor

- **The Input:** When **Voltage exceeds 7.0** (Paradox / Thermal Tension), the battery activates.
- **The Charge:** It captures the excess tension.
- **The Use:** If **ATP drops below 15** (Starvation), the battery automatically discharges to keep the system alive.

### B. The Incentive

You are no longer forced to write "Light" text to survive. You can write "Heavy" text, provided it is **True**.

- _Weak Heavy Text:_ "The situation is basically difficult." -> **High Drag / Zero Voltage.** (You Starve).
- _Strong Heavy Text:_ "The frozen fire burns coldly." -> **High Drag / High Voltage.** (You Charge).

## 3. THE UG LAYER (GOVERNMENT & BINDING)

**v3.6.5** implements a new physics kernel based on **Universal Grammar Principles**. We have moved from "checking lists" to "measuring relationships."

### A. Principle 1: The Case Filter (Gravity vs. Orbit)

* **The Law:** "Every phonetically realized NP must be assigned Case."
* **The Physics:** Heavy Matter (Nouns) creates Gravity. Kinetic Energy (Verbs) creates Orbit.
* **The Violation:** If you have massive Nouns without enough Kinetic Verbs (`Kinetic / Heavy < 0.33`), the system collapses into a Black Hole.
* **The Penalty:** **Mass Impact x 1.5**. Stagnation is now fatal.
* **The Fix:** You must add velocity to orbit the mass. _"The stone fell"_ is stable. _"The stone"_ is a crash.

### B. Principle 2: The ECP (Ghosts vs. Shells)

* **The Law:** "Traces must be properly governed." (The Empty Category Principle).
* **The Physics:** Abstract concepts are "Ghosts." They must be anchored to Heavy Matter to exist in reality.
* **The Violation:** If you have multiple Abstracts (> 2) but ZERO Heavy Matter, you are hallucinating.
* **The Penalty:** **Hollow Voltage.** The text may be "Light" (low drag), but it is classified as "Grease/Sycophancy" because it has no mass.
* **The Fix:** Give the ghost a body. _"The system optimization protocol"_ is a ghost. _"The protocol burned the iron"_ is real.

## 4. THE KINTSUGI PROTOCOL (ANTI-FRAGILITY)

If the Battery fails and the system hits critical failure, the Golden Repair offers a final bargain.

### A. The Critical State

When **ATP drops below 10**, the physics engine issues a **Koan**.

- _Example:_ "Gravity is too heavy. Make the stone float."

### B. The Golden Repair

If the user responds with **High Whimsy** or **High Paradox**:

1. **The Recognition:** The system detects the breakthrough.
2. **The Gold:** The crack is filled.
3. **The Reward:** **ATP is instantly restored to 50.**

## 5. THE RESONANCE ENGINE

### A. The Frequency Modulator (ATP-Gated)

The Radio is powered by **ATP**.

- **STARVATION (< 15 ATP):** Luxury stations (**MICHAEL**, **JESTER**) are disabled. **CLARENCE** becomes hyper-aggressive (Threshold drops to 2.5).
- **ABUNDANCE:** All stations active.

|**Frequency**|**Station**|**Persona**|**Trigger**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**88.5 FM**|**CLARENCE**|The Butcher|High Drag. "Cut the fat."|
|**94.2 FM**|**ELOISE**|The Grounder|High Entropy. "Give me a stone."|
|**101.1 FM**|**YAGA**|The Witch|Toxins / Hedging. "Tell the truth."|
|**108.0 FM**|**MICHAEL**|The Vibe|Whimsy. "Float on."|
|**104.5 FM**|**THE PHILOSOPHER**|The Synthesis|**Interference.** "Density meets Abstraction."|
|**108.9 FM**|**THE JESTER**|The Paradox|**High Voltage.** "The contradiction is the fuel."|

### B. The Thermal Coupler

- **VOLT (Voltage):** Raw Intensity. (Kinetic + Thermal Tension).
- **β (Beta Friction):** Stability. (`Voltage / Drag`). High Beta = Paradox Stability.

## 6. BIOLOGY & TIME (PERSISTENCE)

### A. The Metabolic Seal

**v3.6.5** ensures that your Genius survives the reboot.

- **ATP & Charge:** Both your metabolic health AND your **Battery Level** are serialized into the save file.
- **Time Travel:** If you `/seed` a session where you had a charged battery, you wake up with that power available.

### B. The Reaper (Garbage Collection)

- **Compost:** Session files older than **24 hours** are automatically deleted on boot.

## 7. THE HUD: FLIGHT DECK

**v3.6.5** expands the instrument panel to show the Capacitor state.

- **Green Bar:** Metabolic Health (ATP).
- **Yellow Bar:** Stored Paradox (Battery).
