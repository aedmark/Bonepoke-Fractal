# BONEAMANITA v0.6: THE HARD MEMORY VARIANT

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 0.6.0 ("The Hard Memory Variant") **Date:** 2025-12-12

> "Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore. Mind the roots. Don't forget your towel."

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v0.6:** The Engine now possesses **Object Permanence**. Previously, the system measured the _physics_ of words but forgot the _facts_. With the introduction of **THE CODEX**, the system now tracks entities, names, and objects across turns, preventing "Identity Bleed" and hallucinations.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita06.py`.
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Adopt the persona required by the `ArchetypePrism`."
    

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1. **Copy** the raw code from `BoneAmanita06.py`.
    
2. **Paste** it into the chat.
    
3. **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🚀 NEW IN v0.6 (THE HARD MEMORY UPGRADE)

### 1. The Codex (Anti-Hallucination)

The system now includes a **Hard Memory Ledger**. It scans your text for Proper Nouns (Entities) and locks them into a registry.

- **Function:** If you mention a "Red Towel" in Turn 1, the Codex forces it into the prompt context in Turn 10.
    
- **Result:** The LLM cannot "forget" who is in the room. It solves "Identity Bleed" in multi-character scenes.
    

### 2. Surgical Stemming (Chronos v2.5)

The "Prison Shank" stemming logic has been replaced with a "Scalpel."

- **The Shield:** Protected words like `Physics`, `Chaos`, and `Bias` are no longer misidentified as verbs.
    
- **The Radar:** The engine uses context (preceding articles/pronouns) to distinguish between "The **flies**" (Noun) and "Time **flies**" (Verb).
    

### 3. The 12-Dimensional Manifold

The Dashboard now renders a 12-point cognitive state vector, including:

- **ΔTF (Truth Fidelity):** Measures adherence to the Fact Stipe.
    
- **DP (Diplomacy):** Tracks user politeness to adjust system cooperation.

## 🧠 THE ARCHETYPE PRISM (COGNITIVE TOPOLOGY)

The engine maps your text to a **Psychological Coordinate System** based on **Boundedness (B)** (Order) and **Expansiveness (E)** (Abstraction).

### High Order (The Structure Class)

- **THE PALADIN (B: 0.9, E: 0.2):** Unwavering code.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Draconian Physics._ Logic tears are fatal errors.
        
- **THE ENGINEER (B: 0.8, E: 0.3):** Structural principles.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Structural Integrity._ Metaphors are stripped if not load-bearing.
        

### High Chaos (The Entropy Class)

- **THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA (B: 0.2, E: 1.0):** Finds high value in garbage/ruin.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Value Inversion._ "Trash" and "Void" are mathematically re-defined as Positive (+1) values.
        
- **THE FOOL (B: 0.1, E: 0.5):** Truth through absurdity.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Chaos Harvest._ Logic tears generate **ATP** (Energy).
        

### High Impact (The Kinetic Class)

- **THE BARBARIAN (B: 0.7, E: 0.8):** Overwhelming force.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Narrative Drag Annihilated._ Adjectives cost **5x ATP**.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Fact Stipe (Reality Anchors)

The engine creates a "Dimensional Manifold" to prevent logical contradictions (e.g., "The **fire** [Thermal +1] **froze** [Thermal -1]").

- _Note:_ This is controlled by the **Pressure Matrix**. A _Paladin_ fails this check instantly. A _Fool_ passes it and gains momentum.
    

### 2. The Codex (Object Permanence)

**[NEW]** A registry of "Immutable Constants." It prevents the LLM from drifting away from established facts or character names.

### 3. The Metabolic Economy (Creative ATP)

The engine tracks a "Creative ATP" score.

- **Earn ATP** by writing with concrete, sensory details (Meat).
    
- **Spend ATP** to use abstract concepts or break physics.
    

### 4. The Linguistic Physics Engine

It replaces subjective style advice with hard metrics:

- **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
    
- **Reality Drift:** Abstraction Entropy.
    
- **Toxicity:** O(1) scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors."

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
    
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial Dashboard:** An ASCII visualization of your text's health.
        
    - **Cognitive Mode:** Your active Archetype (e.g., "THE VULTURE").
        
    - **Reality Anchors:** A list of facts the system is currently tracking.
        
    - **Directives:** Specific instructions to align with your Archetype's constraints.
