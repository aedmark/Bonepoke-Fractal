# BONEAMANITA v0.5.2: THE PRESSURE VARIANT

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 0.5.2 ("The Pressure Variant")

> "Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore. The laws of physics are not universal; they are personal."

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v0.5.2:** The Engine now applies **Archetypal Pressure**. It doesn't just _tell_ you that you sound like a Barbarian; it _punishes_ you like one. If you are a Paladin, logic tears are fatal. If you are a Fool, logic tears fuel your creativity.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita052.py`.
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Adopt the persona required by the `ArchetypePrism`."
    

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1. **Copy** the raw code from `BoneAmanita052.py`.
    
2. **Paste** it into the chat.
    
3. **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."
    

## 🧠 THE ARCHETYPE PRISM (COGNITIVE TOPOLOGY)

The engine maps your text to a **Psychological Coordinate System** based on **Boundedness (B)** (Order) and **Expansiveness (E)** (Abstraction).

Based on your coordinates, the engine assigns a Cognitive Mode. **In v0.5.2, these modes come with specific Physics Constraints:**

### High Order (The Structure Class)

- **THE PALADIN (B: 0.9, E: 0.2):** Unwavering code.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Draconian Physics._ Logic tears are fatal errors. Zero tolerance for contradiction.
        
- **THE ENGINEER (B: 0.8, E: 0.3):** Structural principles. Elegant efficiency.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Structural Integrity._ High translation fidelity required. Metaphors are stripped if not load-bearing.
        
- **THE SPY (B: 0.8, E: 0.6):** Duplicitous surface, singular purpose.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Deep Cover._ Logic tears are detected internally but hidden from the output to maintain narrative coherence.
        

### High Chaos (The Entropy Class)

- **THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA (B: 0.2, E: 1.0):** Finds high value in garbage/ruin.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Value Inversion._ "Trash" and "Void" are mathematically re-defined as Positive (+1) values.
        
- **THE FOOL (B: 0.1, E: 0.5):** Truth through absurdity.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Chaos Harvest._ Logic tears and paradoxes generate **ATP** (Energy) instead of costing it.
        

### High Impact (The Kinetic Class)

- **THE BARBARIAN (B: 0.7, E: 0.8):** Overwhelming force.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Narrative Drag Annihilated._ Adjectives and passive verbs cost **5x ATP**. Hesitation is death.
        

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Pressure Matrix (New)

The central switchboard that translates your Archetype into engine settings. It adjusts:

- **Tolerance Mode:** Can the text contradict itself? (Standard, Draconian, Inverted, Loose).
    
- **Chaos Threshold:** How easily does the _Muscaria_ trigger hallucinations?
    
- **Drag Multiplier:** How expensive is it to be slow?
    

### 2. The Fact Stipe (Dynamic Truth)

The engine creates a "Dimensional Manifold" to prevent logical contradictions (e.g., "The **fire** [Thermal +1] **froze** [Thermal -1]").

- **Update:** This is now controlled by the **Pressure Matrix**. A _Paladin_ fails this check instantly. A _Fool_ passes it and gains momentum.
    

### 3. The Metabolic Economy (Variable Gearing)

The engine tracks a "Creative ATP" score.

- **Earn ATP** by writing with concrete, sensory details (Meat).
    
- **Spend ATP** to use abstract concepts or break physics.
    
- **Metabolic Gearing:** The cost of "spending" depends on your Archetype. A _Barbarian_ pays a heavy tax for "Thinking" words but pays nothing for "Action" words.
    

### 4. The Linguistic Physics Engine

It replaces subjective style advice with hard metrics:

- **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
    
- **Reality Drift:** Abstraction Entropy.
    
- **Toxicity:** O(1) scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors."
    

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
    
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial Dashboard:** An ASCII visualization of your text's health.
        
    - **The Archetype:** It will tell you _what_ you sound like (e.g., "COGNITIVE MODE: THE VULTURE").
        
    - **Pressure Warning:** e.g., "SYSTEM: LAW OF THE TEMPLAR: Logic tears are fatal."
        
    - **Directives:** Specific instructions to align with your Archetype's constraints.
