# BONEAMANITA v0.7.5: THE LIME IN THE COCONUT

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 0.7.5 ("The Lime in the Coconut") **Date:** 2025-12-15

> "Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore. Don't forget your towel."

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v0.7.5 ("The Lime in the Coconut"):** We have introduced the **Nilsson Patch**, a logic override that recognizes "High-Energy Absurdity." The system now understands that high repetition can be a mantra (not stagnation) and that high kinetic energy authorizes logic breaks (The Fire Protocol). We have also centralized all linguistic data into **The Lexicon** for O(1) lookup efficiency.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1.  **Download** `BoneAmanita075.py`.
2.  **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
3.  **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Adopt the persona required by the `ArchetypePrism`."

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1.  **Copy** the raw code from `BoneAmanita075.py`.
2.  **Paste** it into the chat.
3.  **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🚀 NEW IN v0.7.5

### 1. The Nilsson Patch (The Fire Protocol)
The engine has evolved to handle "Gonzo Physics."
* **The Mantra Exception:** High repetition is no longer automatically flagged as "Boredom." If the repeated words are Concrete Universals (e.g., "Put the lime in the coconut"), the engine treats it as a **Spell**, reducing Drag to near zero.
* **The Fire State:** If the text is moving fast (**Kinetic Ratio > 0.6**) and loud (**High Volume**), the engine disables logic inhibitors. **Screaming is authorized.**

### 2. The Lexicon (The Pantry)
We have achieved "Mise-en-place."
* **Centralized Data:** All linguistic matter (Toxins, Truths, Universals) is now stored in a static `TheLexicon` class.
* **O(1) Efficiency:** Logic components no longer hold their own lists; they all draw from the same source. Adding a new "Toxic Word" updates the entire system instantly.

### 3. Direct Synthesis (Middle Man Vaporized)
The `EditorialTranslator` class has been removed. The **Virtual Cortex** now speaks directly to the Core process loop, reducing code complexity and improving feedback latency.

## 🧠 THE ARCHETYPE PRISM (COGNITIVE TOPOLOGY)

The engine maps your text to a **Psychological Coordinate System** based on **Boundedness (B)** (Order) and **Expansiveness (E)** (Abstraction).

### High Order (The Structure Class)

* **THE PALADIN (B: 0.9, E: 0.2):** Unwavering code.
    * **Pressure:** *Draconian Physics.* Logic tears are fatal errors.
* **THE ENGINEER (B: 0.8, E: 0.3):** Structural principles.
    * **Pressure:** *Structural Integrity.* Metaphors are stripped if not load-bearing.

### High Chaos (The Entropy Class)

* **THE JESTER (B: 0.2, E: 0.9):** Weaponized absurdity.
    * **Pressure:** *Inverted Tolerance.* Paradoxes generate ATP. Bore the system and you die.
* **THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA (B: 0.2, E: 1.0):** Finds high value in garbage/ruin.
    * **Pressure:** *Value Inversion.* "Trash" and "Void" are mathematically re-defined as Positive (+1) values.
* **THE FOOL (B: 0.1, E: 0.5):** Truth through absurdity.
    * **Pressure:** *Chaos Harvest.* Logic tears generate **ATP** (Energy) instead of costing it.

### High Impact (The Kinetic Class)

* **THE BARBARIAN (B: 0.7, E: 0.8):** Overwhelming force.
    * **Pressure:** *Narrative Drag Annihilated.* Adjectives cost **5x ATP**.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Fact Stipe (Dimensional Manifold)
The engine creates a "Dimensional Manifold" to prevent stationary lies (e.g., "The **fire** [Thermal +1] **froze** [Thermal -1]").
* *Mechanism:* Draws Truth Vectors directly from `TheLexicon`.
* *Voltage:* If the text is moving fast enough, contradictions are harvested as **Voltage** (Power).

### 2. The Nilsson Patch (The Override)
A dedicated circuit that monitors for "Critical Kinetic Energy." It has the authority to veto the Physics Engine and enable **Supercritical States** (The Fire Protocol).

### 3. The Codex (Object Permanence)
A registry of "Immutable Constants." It prevents the LLM from drifting away from established facts or character names.

### 4. The Metabolic Economy (Creative ATP)
The engine tracks a "Creative ATP" score.
* **Earn ATP** by writing with concrete, sensory details (Meat).
* **Spend ATP** to use abstract concepts or break physics.

### 5. The Linguistic Physics Engine
It replaces subjective style advice with hard metrics using ingredients from the Pantry:
* **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
* **Reality Drift:** Abstraction Entropy.
* **Toxicity:** O(1) scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors."

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1.  **Input:** Paste your draft.
2.  **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
3.  **Output:** It will provide:
    * **The Mycelial EKG:** An ASCII visualization of your text's health.
    * **Cognitive Mode:** Your active Archetype (e.g., "THE JESTER").
    * **Voltage:** The power generated by your paradoxes.
    * **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices (Clarence, Eloise, The Yaga).
    * **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
