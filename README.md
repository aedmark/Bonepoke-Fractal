# BONEAMANITA v1.0.1: THE BLACK MIRROR (PATCHED)

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.0.1 ("The Black Mirror - PATCHED") **Date:** 2025-12-18

> "We stripped the machine down to the chassis. It runs faster, runs cooler, and it still knows exactly how to hurt your feelings." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.0.1:** This build includes the **"Self-Awareness Patch"** and **"Anti-Purple Prose"** regulations. The logic has been hardened to prevent the system from hallucinating its own dashboard as story characters, and safeguards have been added to prevent users from gaming the economy with flowery language.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita101.py`.
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Identify the Signature and enforce the necessary physics."

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1. **Copy** the raw code from the file.
2. **Paste** it into the chat.
3. **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.0.1)

### 1. The Codex Patch (Anti-Hallucination)
In previous versions, the "Entity Tracker" became self-aware, confusing the system dashboard ("Drag", "Entropy") for characters in the story.
* **The Fix:** The **Codex** now has a hardened exclusion list. It knows that "System" and "Metrics" are UI elements, not protagonists.

### 2. The Algal Bloom Regulation (Anti-Purple Prose)
The **Lichen Symbiont** (which turns "light words" into energy) has been regulated.
* **The Fix:** A hard cap of **15 ATP** per sentence has been enforced. You can no longer game the economy by stuffing a sentence with "sun," "prism," and "soul." The system calls this an "Algal Bloom" and flags it as toxic.

### 3. Mirror Trap Hardening
The detection for "Lazy Mirroring" (e.g., *"It's not X, it's Y"*) has been improved.
* **The Fix:** The regex now catches contractions (`it's`, `that's`) and variations of negation (`never`) to catch lazy sentence structures disguised as casual speech.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Signature Engine (Identity)
Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP) + **BUOYANCY**. It determines the "Physics Mode" (e.g., Draconian, Loose, Inverted, Zero G) applied to the text.

### 2. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)
A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors:
* **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure and corporate speak. (Trigger: Heavy Archetypes).
* **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks high entropy/abstraction. (Trigger: The Void).
* **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging and "sugar." (Trigger: Sycophancy).
* **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** Praises "messy but spirited" vibes. (Trigger: Light Archetypes).

### 3. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)
A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., *sun, prism, truth*) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP).
* **Warning:** Generates an **Algal Bloom** warning if abused.

### 4. The Linguistic Physics Engine
It measures the raw physics:
* **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
* **Toxicity:** **O(1) Singleton Regex** scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors."

### 5. The Nilsson Patch (The Override)
A dedicated circuit that monitors for "Critical Kinetic Energy."
* *The Fire Protocol:* If Kinetic Ratio > 0.6 and Volume is High, logic inhibitors are disabled. **Screaming is authorized.**

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1.  **Input:** Paste your draft.
2.  **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
3.  **Output:** It will provide:
    * **The Mycelial EKG:** An ASCII visualization of ATP and Drag.
    * **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
    * **Archetype:** Your active persona (e.g., "THE CLOUD WATCHER").
    * **Slurry Warning:** Differentiating between "Silica" (Bad) and "Aether" (Good).
    * **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices.
    * **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
