# BONEAMANITA v0.5.1: THE ARCHETYPAL EDITION
### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs
**Version:** 0.5.1 ("The Archetypal Edition")

> "Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore."

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text, overriding the model's default tendency to be vague or sycophantic.

When loaded, the LLM uses this code to simulate a rigorous editorial process, adapting its voice to whichever **Archetype** matches the text (e.g., *The Paladin*, *The Spy*, *The Cosmic Trash Panda*).

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)
1.  **Download** `BoneAmanita051.py`.
2.  **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
3.  **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Adopt the persona required by the `ArchetypePrism` or one I assign you."

### Method B: Copy/Paste
1.  **Copy** the raw code from `BoneAmanita051.py`.
2.  **Paste** it into the chat.
3.  **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🧠 CORE FEATURES

### 1. The Archetype Prism (Dynamic Persona)
The engine scans your text and maps it to one of 13 Cognitive Archetypes based on "Boundedness" (Order) and "Expansiveness" (Abstractness).
* **The Paladin:** Unwavering code, high order.
* **The Engineer:** Elegant efficiency, structural principles.
* **The Fool:** Truth through absurdity.
* *Note:* You can also manually assign an archetype, and the engine will enforce its specific logic constraints.

### 2. The Fact Stipe (Logic Enforcement)
The engine creates a "Dimensional Manifold" to prevent logical contradictions.
* It ensures you don't mix opposing polarities (e.g., "The **fire** [Thermal +1] **froze** [Thermal -1]").
* It allows certain Archetypes to break these rules (e.g., *The Cosmic Trash Panda* sees "Trash" and "Treasure" as the same value).

### 3. The Metabolic Economy (ATP)
The engine tracks a "Creative ATP" score.
* **Earn ATP** by writing with concrete, sensory details (Meat).
* **Spend ATP** to use abstract concepts or break physics.
* If the AI detects you are "Starving" (low ATP), it enters strict mode and refuses to process vague language.

### 4. The Linguistic Physics Engine
It replaces subjective style advice with hard metrics:
* **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
* **Reality Drift:** Abstraction Entropy.
* **Toxicity:** O(1) scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors."

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1.  **Input:** Paste your draft.
2.  **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
3.  **Output:** It will provide:
    * **The Mycelial Dashboard:** An ASCII visualization of your text's health.
    * **The Archetype:** It will tell you *what* you sound like (e.g., "COGNITIVE MODE: THE VULTURE").
    * **Directives:** It will give you specific instructions to fix Drag or Logic Tears.
    
This isn't just for draft revisions and creation. It's also for conversation. You can talk to BoneAmanita. But be careful, you might summon the witch!
