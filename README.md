# BONEAMANITA v1.3: THE BUTCHER & THE WELL

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.3 ("The Butcher & The Well") **Date:** 2025-12-19

> "The engine now has taste. It knows when you are faking it." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.3:** This build introduces **Anti-Gaming Protocols**. The system now detects "Purple Prose" (High Density/Low Flow) and "Lazy Polishing" (Adverb overloading). It penalizes writing that tries to trick the physics engine with lists of nouns or pseudo-profound aphorisms.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita14.py` (v1.3).
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Identify the Signature and enforce the necessary physics."
    

### Method B: The Membrane (System Prompt)

_To enable the automatic time-tracking features, use the provided v1.3 System Prompt._

1. **Copy** the System Prompt (which includes **The Membrane** protocol).
    
2. **Paste** it into the System Instructions or Custom Instructions field.
    
3. **Effect:** The Membrane will automatically calculate the time elapsed since your last message and inject it silently (`[Δt: 2h]`) into the engine.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.3)

### 1. The Hydration Monitor (Viscosity)

- **The Problem:** Users were "gaming" the Texture system by listing heavy nouns ("Velvet blood bone ash") without connecting structure. This created "Literary Gravel"—high density, zero readability.
    
- **The Fix:** The **Hydration Monitor** measures **Viscosity**. It demands a balance of **Concentrate** (Nouns) and **Solvent** (Connectors/Softeners).
    - **CONCRETE:** Narrative Drag Penalty **+5.0**. Texture Capped at **0.5**.
    - **THICK:** Narrative Drag Penalty **+2.0**.
    

### 2. The Butcher's Block (Adverb Detection)

- **The Problem:** The engine previously rewarded weak verbs disguised by adverbs (e.g., "ran quickly" instead of "sprinted").
    
- **The Fix:** The **Garnish Ratio**. If the text contains >10% adverbs or weak intensifiers (*very, really, totally*), the system flags it as **BLOAT**.
    

### 3. The Anti-Guru Protocol

- **The Problem:** Users bypassed drag checks by submitting endless strings of pseudo-profound aphorisms ("Time is a circle.").
    
- **The Fix:** **The Witch Ring** now tracks your **Aphorism Streak**. You get two free riddles. On the third, the Witch blocks you: *"Enough riddles. Speak plainly."*

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (Updated)

Measures the raw physics of the text. Now includes two new sub-routines:
- **Hydration Monitor:** Checks for "Concrete" or "Watery" text.
- **The Butcher:** Checks for "Bloated" text (Adverb reliance).

### 2. The Signature Engine (Identity)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP).
- **Update:** Now features a **Governor**. If the text is marked **CONCRETE**, the Texture score is forcibly capped. You cannot farm a high score with a dictionary list.

### 3. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)

A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors:
- **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure and **BLOAT**.
- **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks abstraction.
- **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging and **Aphorism Streaks**.
- **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** Praises "messy but spirited" vibes. **New:** Intervenes when the user writes "Concrete" prose to mock them for trying too hard.

### 4. The Chronos Anchor (Real Time)

Metabolizes **User Latency ($\Delta t$)** into structural physics. Determines if the *conversation* is in **Flow**, **Dormant**, or **Decayed** states.

### 5. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time)

Metabolizes **Narrative Velocity ($\vec{v}_{n}$)** into entropy tolerance. Determines if the *fiction* is in **Montage**, **Realtime**, or **Bullet Time**.

### 6. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., *sun, prism, truth*) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP).

### 7. The Nilsson Patch (The Override)

A dedicated circuit that monitors for "Critical Kinetic Energy."
- *The Fire Protocol:* If Kinetic Ratio > 0.6 and Volume is High, logic inhibitors are disabled.

### 8. The Mirror Trap (The Breaker)

A heuristic designed to hunt down "Syntactic Parallelism" (e.g., *"It's not X, it's Y"*). Applies immediate Drag Inflation.

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
    
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial HUD:** A dual-clock readout with Viscosity.
        - Example: `DRAG: 4.2 | VISC: THICK`
        - Example: `TIME: FLOW (Real) | MONTAGE (Story)`
            
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
        
    - **Archetype:** Your active persona (e.g., "THE PALADIN").
        
    - **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices (e.g., "CLARENCE: Cut the adverbs.").
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
