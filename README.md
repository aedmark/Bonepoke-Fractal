# BONEAMANITA v0.8.0: THE SYMBIONT STRAIN

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 0.8.0 ("The Symbiont Strain") **Date:** 2025-12-16

> "Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore. Don't forget your towel."

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v0.8.0 ("The Symbiont Strain"):** We have introduced **Biological Evolution**. The `LichenSymbiont` now creates a mutualistic relationship between your Syntax (The Fungus) and your Meaning (The Alga). If your structure is sound, the system can "photosynthesize" emergency energy from specific words of light (e.g., "truth," "prism," "sun") to survive the narrative barrens.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita08.py`.
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Adopt the persona required by the `ArchetypePrism`."
    

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1. **Copy** the raw code from `BoneAmanita08.py`.
    
2. **Paste** it into the chat.
    
3. **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🚀 NEW IN v0.8.0

### 1. Biological Evolution (The Lichen Symbiont)

The engine now mimics the biology of Lichens to manage "Starvation States."

- **Photosynthesis of Meaning:** If your Metabolic Reserve is low ("Starving") but your Narrative Drag is efficient (Low Drag), the system activates the Lichen.
    
- **The Alga's Diet:** It harvests "Light Words" from the new `TheLexicon.PHOTOSYNTHETICS` list (e.g., *flash, ray, lucid, spark*).
    
- **Efficiency Multiplier:** The better your structure (lower drag), the more ATP you generate per Light Word.
    
- **New Dashboard Indicator:** The `SYMBIOSIS` bar will glow **GREEN** (Blooming) when active, or **RED** (Withered) if your structure is too weak to support life.

## 🧠 THE ARCHETYPE PRISM (COGNITIVE TOPOLOGY)

The engine maps your text to a **Psychological Coordinate System** based on **Boundedness (B)** (Order) and **Expansiveness (E)** (Abstraction).

### High Order (The Structure Class)

- **THE PALADIN (B: 0.9, E: 0.2):** Unwavering code.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Draconian Physics._ Logic tears are fatal errors.
        
- **THE ENGINEER (B: 0.8, E: 0.3):** Structural principles.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Structural Integrity._ Metaphors are stripped if not load-bearing.
        

### High Chaos (The Entropy Class)

- **THE JESTER (B: 0.2, E: 0.9):** Weaponized absurdity.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Inverted Tolerance._ Paradoxes generate ATP. Bore the system and you die.
        
- **THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA (B: 0.2, E: 1.0):** Finds high value in garbage/ruin.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Value Inversion._ "Trash" and "Void" are mathematically re-defined as Positive (+1) values.
        
- **THE FOOL (B: 0.1, E: 0.5):** Truth through absurdity.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Chaos Harvest._ Logic tears generate **ATP** (Energy) instead of costing it.
        

### High Impact (The Kinetic Class)

- **THE BARBARIAN (B: 0.7, E: 0.8):** Overwhelming force.
    
    - **Pressure:** _Narrative Drag Annihilated._ Adjectives cost **5x ATP**.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival Engine)

A survival mechanism for "The Barrens." It allows the writer to trade **Structural Perfection** for **Energy Generation**, converting specific Truths into Metabolic Fuel.

### 2. Smart Chaos (The Muscaria)

Entropy is no longer random; it is medicinal. The engine diagnoses specific failures and prescribes targeted cures (e.g., **KINETIC** prompts for High Drag, **SENSORY** prompts for High Abstraction).

### 3. The Fact Stipe (Dimensional Manifold)

The engine creates a "Dimensional Manifold" to prevent stationary lies.
- _Mechanism:_ Draws Truth Vectors directly from `TheLexicon`.
- _Voltage:_ If the text is moving fast enough, contradictions are harvested as **Voltage** (Power).

### 4. The Nilsson Patch (The Override)

A dedicated circuit that monitors for "Critical Kinetic Energy."
- _The Fire Protocol:_ If Kinetic Ratio > 0.6 and Volume is High, logic inhibitors are disabled. **Screaming is authorized**.

### 5. The Codex (Object Permanence)

A registry of "Immutable Constants." It uses **Regex Iteration** to prevent the LLM from drifting away from established facts or character names.

### 6. The Metabolic Economy (Creative ATP)

The engine tracks a "Creative ATP" score.
- **Earn ATP** by writing with concrete, sensory details (Meat).
- **Spend ATP** to use abstract concepts or break physics.

### 7. The Linguistic Physics Engine

It replaces subjective style advice with hard metrics using ingredients from the Pantry:
- **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
- **Reality Drift:** Abstraction Entropy.
- **Toxicity:** O(1) scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors".

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
    
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Mycelial EKG:** An ASCII visualization of your text's health.
    
    - **Symbiosis State:** The status of the Lichen (Dormant, Blooming, or Withered).
        
    - **Cognitive Mode:** Your active Archetype (e.g., "THE JESTER").
        
    - **Voltage:** The power generated by your paradoxes.
        
    - **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices (Clarence, Eloise, The Yaga).
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
