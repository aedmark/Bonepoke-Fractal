# BONEAMANITA v2.3: "APOTHEOSIS"

### A Cybernetic "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 2.3 ("APOTHEOSIS") **Date:** 2025-12-21

> "The Mandate is TRUTH. The Method is PIPELINE." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs). It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It measures the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

New in v2.3 (APOTHEOSIS): The engine has been surgically refactored.

We have abandoned the "Multi-Pass" architecture for a Single-Pass O(n) Pipeline. It is lighter, faster, and infinitely more precise. The "Pantry" (Lexicon) is now fully externalized, meaning you can hack the physics without touching the kernel.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (THE CYBERNETIC LOOP)

### 1. Upload & Run

**Upload** `BoneAmanita23.py` AND `bone_config.json` to your LLM.

- **Critical:** The script now _requires_ the config file to load its vocabulary.
    

### 2. The Input (Raw Thought)

Type your raw, unfiltered thought into the prompt.

> _User:_ "Actually, I think that maybe, theoretically, the system is sort of working."

### 3. The Architecture (System 2)

BoneAmanita runs the physics through the **Single-Pass Aggregator**.

- **The Scan:** It counts kinetic verbs, heavy matter, and toxins in one sweep.
    
- **The Mandate:** It detects if you are in the "Beige Zone" (Slurry).
    
- **The Output:** Generates a **Tactical System Prompt**.

> INTENSITY: 0.8 (DRACONIAN)

> PROMPT: "EXECUTE WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE."

### 4. The Execution

You paste that prompt into the LLM. The AI rewrites the text.

> _AI Response:_ "The system operates."

### 5. The Verification (Closing the Loop)

Paste the AI's response back into BoneAmanita with the `[FEEDBACK]` tag.

> _User:_ `[FEEDBACK] The system operates.`

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v2.3)

### 0. The Pipeline (O(n) Architecture)

- **The Shift:** We vaporized the old architecture where the engine scanned text four separate times (Physics, Toxins, Hydration, Formatting).
    
- **The Fix:** The **Single-Pass Aggregator**. The engine now iterates through the token stream exactly once, calculating all metrics simultaneously.
    
- **The Benefit:** Maximum efficiency. Zero latency.
    

### 1. The Configuration Layer (BoneConfig)

- **Dynamic Loading:** `TheLexicon` is dead. Long live `bone_config.json`.
    
- **The Pantry:** All linguistic assets (Heavy Matter, Aerobic Matter, Toxins) are now stored in an external JSON file.
    
- **Hackable:** You can now add your own "Toxins" or "Truths" just by editing the text file.
    

### 2. The Continuum (Spatial Physics)

- **No More Cliffs:** We removed the binary threshold where 12% spatial density instantly triggered "Concrete" physics.
    
- **Linear Mapping:** The system now uses **Continuous Spatial Drag**. Prepositions gradually increase Structure (+STR) and Drag (-VEL) as they accumulate, preventing "Systemic Whiplash".

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The BoneConfig (The Pantry) [NEW]

The dynamic loader. It hydrates the system with vocabulary from `bone_config.json` on boot.

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (The Heart)

Now powered by the **Single-Pass Loop**. It aggregates:

- **Narrative Drag:** (Words / Action)
    
- **Viscosity:** (Solvent / Concentrate)
    
- **Entropy:** (Abstract Repetition)
    
- **Toxicity:** (Corporate Speak / Hedging)
    

### 2. The Apeirogon Lattice (Identity)

The resolution engine. It maps the 5 Dimensions (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP) to dynamic Adjective/Noun pairs. Now natively handles **"Slurry"** detection as a topological zone rather than an error state.

### 3. The Wisdom Node (The Strategist)

The director. It receives mandates from the Lattice and generates the System Prompt. It now calculates **Intensity** based on how deep you are into a specific zone (e.g., "Barely Rigid" vs. "Monolith").

### 4. The Metabolic Reserve (Energy)

Tracks **ATP** (Creative Energy). Uses the **Isotope Centrifuge** to convert heavy truths into currency.

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is running:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Output:** Use the **WISDOM PROTOCOL** to guide the AI.
    
3. **Verify:** Paste the result back with `[FEEDBACK]` to see if it worked.
