# 🍄 BONEAMANITA v0.1.2: The Red Cap Build

> _"Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore."_

**BoneAmanita** is not a grammar checker. It is a **"Digital Hydroponics"** engine designed to filter raw data until it becomes **"Portable Truth."**

It operates on the belief that bad writing isn't just a syntax error—it is a moral failing. It uses **Linguistic Physics** to measure the weight, velocity, and temperature of your words, rejecting "Zombie Nouns" and rewarding "Kinetic Vectors."

## 🧠 The Architecture: The Hex-Brain

BoneAmanita does not "read" text; it metabolizes it through six simultaneous lenses.

### 1. The Witch Ring (The Baba Yaga Protocol)

**Function:** Authenticity Gatekeeper. The system smells fear. If you open with empty pleasantries ("I hope this email finds you well"), the **Witch** rejects you immediately.

> _Status: Active. She demands Meat, not Sugar._

### 2. The Lattice (Linguistic Physics)

**Function:** Cognitive Aerodynamics. We measure **Narrative Drag** (the ratio of words to action).

- **Enemy:** Stative verbs (_is, was, seems_).
    
- **Ally:** Kinetic verbs (_run, break, devour_).
    
- **The Barrens:** A critical failure state where text is high-abstraction and low-connection.
    

### 3. The Metabolic Reserve (Creative ATP)

**Function:** An Economy of Style. You earn **ATP** by writing grounded, concrete truths (_blood, stone, rust_). You spend ATP to use abstract concepts (_framework, paradigm_).

- **STARVING:** You are broke. You are forbidden from using big words until you touch the grass.
    
- **GLUTTON:** You are rich. You have earned the right to be philosophical.
    

### 4. The Mycelial Network (Genetic History)

**Function:** Provenance Tracking. The system tracks the **Lineage** of a thought. It remembers the draft you wrote five minutes ago and compares the "Genetic Drift." It encourages evolution, not just correction.

### 5. The Shimmer (Editorial Translator)

**Function:** The User Interface. Converts raw math into a Socratic dialogue between two distinct personalities (see _The Cast_).

### 6. The Muscaria (The Chaos Engine)

**Function:** Entropy Injection. If your writing becomes too predictable (High Repetition + High Abstraction), the system throws a **Molotov Cocktail** to break the probability curve.

## 🎭 The Cast (The LLM Personas)

BoneAmanita runs on a Python core, but speaks through a team of "Living" System Prompts.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Persona**|**Role**|**Vibe**|
|**CLARENCE**|The Zoning Inspector|A moral philosopher who treats passive voice as a sin. He manages your **ATP Budget**. If you are "Starving," he becomes a tyrant.|
|**ELOISE**|The Loam|The empathetic host. She grounds your brittle ideas with "Universals" (hand, light, salt). She ensures the house is warm enough to live in.|
|**ZIGGY**|The Chaos Agent|He is not always here. But when the **Muscaria** activates, he slides in with a welder's mask to burn your boring sentences down.|
|**ROBERTA**|The Suburban Phoenix|The RAG Agent. A street-smart trash panda turned ethicist. She generates the raw material for the others to refine.|

## 📟 The Mycelial Dashboard (The EKG)

Every output includes a real-time visualization of the text's health.

```
--- MYCELIAL EKG ---
CREATIVE ATP    |██████████░░░░░░░░░░| (STABLE)
NARRATIVE DRAG  |████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░| (1.2 - Fast)
REALITY DRIFT   |██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░| (0.5 - Grounded)
CHAOS PRESSURE  |░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░| (Safe)
---------------------------------------------
DOMINANT STYLE : CLARET (Visceral/Human)
INTERVENTION   : DORMANT
GENETIC HISTORY:
  └─ [Gen 1] Drag: 4.5 (Crystal - Brittle)
  └─ [Gen 2] Drag: 1.2 (Claret - Living)
---------------------------------------------
```

## 🔄 The Workflow: The Relay Loop

BoneAmanita is designed for a **Recursive Relay** between RAG (Generation) and Audit (Correction).

1. **The Spark:** You give a raw concept to **Roberta**.
    
2. **The Generation:** Roberta generates a draft using the BoneAmanita engine logic.
    
3. **The Audit:** The draft is passed to **Eloise & Clarence**.
    
    - They run the **Witch Test** (Is it real?).
        
    - They calculate **ATP** (Can we afford this?).
        
    - They render the **Dashboard**.
        
4. **The Refinement:** They ask a "High-Value Question" back to Roberta.
    
5. **The Loop:** Roberta answers, generating a new "Generation" in the **Mycelial Network**.
    
6. **The Harvest:** Once the ATP is stable and Drag is low, the text is harvested.
    

## 🛠 Usage

### Option A: The Python Core (`BoneAmanita01.py`)

Run the script directly to process text strings through the hard-coded logic.

```
python BoneAmanita01.py
```

### Option B: The LLM Personas (`.txt` Prompts)

1. Load `Roberta 0.1.txt` into your Generator (ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude).
    
2. Load `Eloise and Clarence 0.1.txt` into your Auditor (or a second chat window).
    
3. Begin the relay.
