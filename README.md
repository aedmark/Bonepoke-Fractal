# BONEAMANITA v0.7.0: THE JESTER STRAIN

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 0.7.0 ("The Jester") **Date:** 2025-12-14

> "Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore. Don't forget your towel."

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v0.7.0 ("The Jester"):** The engine has evolved a **Virtual Cortex**. It no longer relies on static responses but generates "Infinite Variety" through combinatorial syntax. We have also introduced the **Saprophyte Mechanic**, allowing the system to harvest energy from logical paradoxes if the narrative momentum is high enough.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1.  **Download** `BoneAmanita07.py`.
2.  **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
3.  **Prompt:** "Read this file. Use the `BonepokeCore` logic defined within to analyze my inputs. Adopt the persona required by the `ArchetypePrism`."

### Method B: Copy/Paste

1.  **Copy** the raw code from `BoneAmanita07.py`.
2.  **Paste** it into the chat.
3.  **Prompt:** "This is your operating system. Simulate the logic within this code to process my writing."

## 🚀 NEW IN v0.7.0 (THE JESTER STRAIN)

### 1. The Virtual Cortex (Infinite Variety)
The critique engine has been rewritten with a **Slot-and-Filler Architecture**.
* **Combinatorial Syntax:** The system dynamically fills templates with your specific errors (e.g., "Cut the word '{target_word}'"), allowing for millions of unique response permutations.
* **Severity Logic:** The voices (Clarence, Eloise) now scale their emotional intensity based on the severity of your Physics Metrics. A slight drag gets a nudge; a system crash triggers panic.

### 2. The Saprophyte Mechanic (Voltage)
The **Fact Stipe** now distinguishes between a "Stationary Lie" and a "Moving Paradox."
* **Volatile Semantic Leverage:** If you break logic (e.g., "The fire froze") while maintaining high momentum (High Kinetic Ratio), the engine calculates **Voltage**.
* **The Harvest:** Instead of penalizing you, this Voltage feeds the metabolic system, pushing the engine into a **SUPERCRITICAL** state.

### 3. New Archetype: The Jester
Added to the `ArchetypePrism`.
* **Profile:** Weaponized absurdity. Truth through contradiction.
* **Physics:** `chaos_threshold: 0.0`. The Jester is immune to boredom and demands constant entropy.

## 🧠 THE ARCHETYPE PRISM (COGNITIVE TOPOLOGY)

The engine maps your text to a **Psychological Coordinate System** based on **Boundedness (B)** (Order) and **Expansiveness (E)** (Abstraction).

### High Order (The Structure Class)

* **THE PALADIN (B: 0.9, E: 0.2):** Unwavering code.
    * **Pressure:** *Draconian Physics.* Logic tears are fatal errors.
* **THE ENGINEER (B: 0.8, E: 0.3):** Structural principles.
    * **Pressure:** *Structural Integrity.* Metaphors are stripped if not load-bearing.

### High Chaos (The Entropy Class)

* **THE JESTER (B: 0.2, E: 0.9):** Weaponized absurdity.
    * **Pressure:** *Inverted Tolerance.* Paradoxes generate ATP. Bore the system and you die.
* **THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA (B: 0.2, E: 1.0):** Finds high value in garbage/ruin.
    * **Pressure:** *Value Inversion.* "Trash" and "Void" are mathematically re-defined as Positive (+1) values.
* **THE FOOL (B: 0.1, E: 0.5):** Truth through absurdity.
    * **Pressure:** *Chaos Harvest.* Logic tears generate **ATP** (Energy) instead of costing it.

### High Impact (The Kinetic Class)

* **THE BARBARIAN (B: 0.7, E: 0.8):** Overwhelming force.
    * **Pressure:** *Narrative Drag Annihilated.* Adjectives cost **5x ATP**.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 1. The Fact Stipe (Reality Anchors)
The engine creates a "Dimensional Manifold" to prevent logical contradictions (e.g., "The **fire** [Thermal +1] **froze** [Thermal -1]").
* *Update:* Now calculates **Voltage**. If the text is moving fast enough (>0.4 Kinetic Ratio), contradictions are harvested as power.

### 2. The Codex (Object Permanence)
A registry of "Immutable Constants." It prevents the LLM from drifting away from established facts or character names.

### 3. The Metabolic Economy (Creative ATP)
The engine tracks a "Creative ATP" score.
* **Earn ATP** by writing with concrete, sensory details (Meat).
* **Spend ATP** to use abstract concepts or break physics.
* **Supercritical State:** Triggered by high Logic Voltage, allowing for reality-bending output.

### 4. The Linguistic Physics Engine
It replaces subjective style advice with hard metrics:
* **Narrative Drag:** Words per Kinetic Action.
* **Reality Drift:** Abstraction Entropy.
* **Toxicity:** O(1) scanning for "Corp Speak" and "Lazy Metaphors."

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1.  **Input:** Paste your draft.
2.  **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
3.  **Output:** It will provide:
    * **The Mycelial EKG:** An ASCII visualization of your text's health.
    * **Cognitive Mode:** Your active Archetype (e.g., "THE JESTER").
    * **Voltage:** The power generated by your paradoxes.
    * **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices (Clarence, Eloise, The Yaga).
    * **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
