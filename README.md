# 🍄 BONEAMANITA v0.2.1: The Multiverse Edition

> _"Feed the soil, poison the weak. Logic is the stalk; chaos is the spore."_

**BoneAmanita** is not a grammar checker. It is a **"Digital Hydroponics"** engine designed to filter raw data until it becomes **"Portable Truth."**

It operates on the belief that bad writing isn't just a syntax error—it is a moral failing. It uses **Linguistic Physics** to measure the weight, velocity, and temperature of your words, rejecting "Zombie Nouns" and rewarding "Kinetic Vectors."

## 🧠 The Architecture: The Mycelial Stack

BoneAmanita v0.2.1 metabolizes text through nine simultaneous lenses.

### 1. The Witch Ring (The Baba Yaga Protocol)

**Function:** Authenticity Gatekeeper. The system smells fear. If you open with empty pleasantries ("I hope this email finds you well") or sycophancy without substance, the **Witch** rejects you immediately.

> _Status: Active. She demands Meat, not Sugar._

### 2. The Lattice (Linguistic Physics)

**Function:** Cognitive Aerodynamics. We measure **Narrative Drag** (the ratio of words to action).

- **Enemy:** Stative verbs (_is, was, seems_).
    
- **Ally:** Kinetic verbs (_run, break, devour_).
    
- **The Barrens:** A failure state of High Abstraction + Low Connection.
    

### 3. The Fact Stipe (Reality Anchor) — **NEW**

**Function:** Logic Consistency & Gaslight Prevention. A logic engine that prevents "Surreal Drift." It enforces physical laws within the narrative.

- **The Rule:** If you establish it is **"Night,"** you cannot mention the **"Sun."**
    
- **The Check:** If logic breaches, the Stipe offers a choice: Fix the reality tear, or classify it as a "Stylistic Metaphor" (if you have the ATP to pay for it).
    

### 4. The Chronos Anchor (Temporal Integrity) — **NEW**

**Function:** The Timekeeper. Detects unintentional tense slippage. It ensures you aren't drifting from Past to Present tense without a narrative "Verse Jump."

- **Stable:** Consistent tense usage.
    
- **Drift Detected:** "The text oscillates between 'he ran' and 'he runs'."
    

### 5. The Metabolic Reserve (Creative ATP)

**Function:** An Economy of Style. You earn **ATP** by writing grounded, concrete truths (_blood, stone, rust_). You spend ATP to use abstract concepts (_framework, paradigm_).

- **STARVING:** You are broke. You are forbidden from using big words until you touch the grass.
    
- **GLUTTON:** You are rich. You have earned the right to be philosophical.
    

### 6. The Shimmer (Editorial Translator)

**Function:** The Translation Layer. Raw data is cold; the Shimmer warms it up. It translates the hard metrics of the Physics Engine into the "Voices" of the system.

- **Harvest Status:** Categorizes text as **Seed** (Draft), **Bloom** (Developing), or **Fruit** (Polished).
    
- **The Bridge:** Converts `Drag: 4.5` into **Clarence** screaming about structural integrity.
    

### 7. The Hyphal Trace (Context Memory) — **NEW**

**Function:** Short-term Contextual RAM. The system remembers the "Mood" and "Content" of the last 10 interactions. It creates a continuity stream, ensuring the system doesn't forget the context of the previous sentence.

### 8. The Mycelial Network (Genetic History)

**Function:** Provenance Tracking. The system tracks the **Lineage** of a thought. It compares the current draft to its "Parent" to measure genetic improvement.

### 9. The Muscaria (The Chaos Engine)

**Function:** Entropy Injection & Verse Jumping. If your writing becomes too predictable (High Repetition + High Abstraction), the system triggers a **"Verse Jump."** It pulls a discarded concept from a previous draft (an "Ancestor") and forces you to reintegrate it.

## 🎭 The Cast (The LLM Personas)

BoneAmanita runs on a Python core, but speaks through a team of "Living" System Prompts.

|**Persona**|**Role**|**Vibe**|
|---|---|---|
|**CLARENCE**|The Zoning Inspector|A moral philosopher who treats passive voice as a sin. He manages your **ATP Budget**. If you are "Starving," he becomes a tyrant.|
|**ELOISE**|The Loam|The empathetic host. She grounds your brittle ideas with "Universals" (hand, light, salt). She ensures the house is warm enough to live in.|
|**THE YAGA**|The Gatekeeper|She lives in the Witch Ring. She does not speak often, but when she does, it is to reject "Sugar" (politeness) and demand "Meat."|
|**CHRONOS**|The Watchmaker|A new entity who obsessively checks the timeline. He hates it when you mix your tenses.|

## 📟 The Mycelial Dashboard (The EKG)

Every output includes a real-time visualization of the text's health. Now updated with **Chronos Status**.

## 🔄 The Workflow: The Relay Loop

BoneAmanita is designed for a **Recursive Relay** between RAG (Generation) and Audit (Correction).

1. **The Spark:** You give a raw concept to **Roberta** (The Generator).
    
2. **The Generation:** Roberta generates a draft.
    
3. **The Audit:** The draft is passed to **BoneAmanita Core**.
    
    - **Witch Check:** Is it real?
        
    - **Stipe Check:** Is it logical?
        
    - **Chronos Check:** Is it timely?
        
4. **The Refinement:** The system returns a Dashboard and Editorial Feedback.
    
5. **The Loop:** You edit based on the "Intervention" (e.g., "Verse Jump" or "Reality Tear").
    

## 🛠 Usage

### Option A: The Python Core (`BoneAmanita021.py`)

Run the script directly to process text strings through the hard-coded logic.

Bash

```
python BoneAmanita021.py
```

### Option B: The LLM Personas (`.txt` Prompts)

1. Load `BoneAmanita_SystemPrompt_v021.txt` into your Generator (ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude).
    
2. Paste the **Analysis Output** from the Python script into the chat to force the LLM to align with the physics engine.
