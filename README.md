# BONEAMANITA v1.4: The Butcher & The Well - Fortified

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.4 ("The Fortified Strain") **Date:** 2025-12-19

> "The engine now remembers where you hid the gun. And it knows that water is wet." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.4:** This build is a **Reality & Memory Patch**. It introduces **Deep Storage** (Object Permanence), **Axiom Injection** (Basic Physics), and closes the "Purple Prose" loophole where users stuffed sentences with adjectives to hide weak nouns.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita14.py` (v1.4).
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Run the `_run_calibration_sequence` to verify integrity. Then, use the `BonepokeCore` logic to analyze my inputs."

### Method B: The Membrane (System Prompt)

_To enable the automatic time-tracking features, use the provided v1.4 System Prompt._

1. **Copy** the System Prompt (which includes **The Membrane** protocol).
2. **Paste** it into the System Instructions or Custom Instructions field.
3. **Effect:** The Membrane will automatically calculate the time elapsed since your last message and inject it silently (`[Δt: 2h]`) into the engine.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.4)

### 1. The Purple Patch (Adjective Bloat)

- **The Exploit:** Users could bypass the Butcher (who only hunted adverbs) by stuffing sentences with decorative adjectives (e.g., _"The massive, ancient, brooding, dark tower"_).
- **The Patch:** **Suffix Scanning**. The Physics Engine now detects adjectival patterns (`-ous`, `-ful`, `-ive`).
    - **Penalty:** Adjectives now contribute to the **Garnish Ratio** (Weight: 0.5). If you decorate a noun too heavily, Drag increases.

### 2. Deep Storage (Object Permanence)

- **The Problem:** The "Goldfish Horizon." The system previously forgot any object mentioned more than 10 turns ago.
- **The Patch:** **The Hippocampus**. Heavy Matter (Guns, Keys, Maps) is now buried in a persistent dictionary. The Muscaria can recall items from the very start of the session.

### 3. Axiom Injection (Reality Definition)

- **The Problem:** The logic engine was blind. It accepted "Dry Oceans" and "Cold Fire" because it didn't know the definitions of words.
- **The Patch:** **Property Inheritance**. The system now loads ~100 essential definitions across 5 dimensions (`THERMAL`, `LUMENS`, `HYDRATION`, etc.).
    - **Effect:** Contradictions (e.g., "Dark Sun") now trigger a **LOGIC TEAR**.

### 4. The Sweat Protocol (Kinetic Exemption)

- **The Problem:** The "Hydration Monitor" unfairly penalized high-energy, rhythmic writing as "FLOODED" because it used too many connectors.
- **The Patch:** **Sweat vs. Water**. If a text is "FLOODED" but maintains a high **Kinetic Ratio** (>25%), the penalty is reduced from **+4.0** to **+1.0**.
    - **Philosophy:** "You are allowed to sweat if you are running."

### 5. The Narcissism Patch (Mirror Trap v2)

- **The Exploit:** The Mirror Trap ("It is not X...") ignored the user talking about themselves.
- **The Patch:** **Self-Reflection**. The regex now targets `(i|we)` negation loops. You cannot waste narrative drag defining who you are *not*.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The Boot Protocol (Calibration)

**Standard Feature:** On startup, the system runs a **Self-Diagnostic**. It feeds itself a toxic "Solvent-Stuffed" sentence. If the engine fails to flag it as `FLOODED`, it issues a warning that the Butcher is offline.

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine

Measures the raw physics of the text.

- **Hydration Monitor:** Detects `CONCRETE`, `WATERY`, `FLOODED` (Fake), and `SWEATING` (High Effort).
- **The Butcher:** Checks for `BLOAT` (Adverb & Adjective reliance).
- **Heuristics:** Scans for suffix patterns (`-ash`, `-olt`, `-ous`).

### 2. The Signature Engine (Identity)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP).

- **Governor:** If Viscosity is `CONCRETE`, Texture is capped at 0.5. You cannot farm points with lists.

### 3. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)

A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors:

- **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure, `BLOAT`, and `FLOODED` text.
- **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks abstraction and "Dead Metaphors."
- **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging, sycophancy, and **Riddles**.
- **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** Intervenes to mock "Concrete/Gaming" attempts.

### 4. The Chronos Anchor (Real Time)

Metabolizes **User Latency ($\Delta t$)** into structural physics. Uses the **System Clock** as a fallback truth.

### 5. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time)

Metabolizes **Narrative Velocity ($\vec{v}_{n}$)** into entropy tolerance. Determines if the _fiction_ is in **Montage** (High Entropy allowed) or **Bullet Time** (High Texture required).

### 6. The Memory System (Deep Storage)

- **Hyphal Trace:** Short-term buffer (10 turns).
- **Deep Storage:** Long-term artifact vault (Infinite).

### 7. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., _sun, prism, truth_) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP).

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    - **The Mycelial HUD:** A dual-clock readout with Viscosity.
        - Example: `DRAG: 4.2 | VISC: SWEATING`
        - Example: `TIME: FLOW (Real) | MONTAGE (Story)`
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
    - **Archetype:** Your active persona (e.g., "THE BARD").
    - **Intervention:** Specific feedback from the voices (e.g., "ELOISE: The sun is not dark. Fix the logic.").
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
