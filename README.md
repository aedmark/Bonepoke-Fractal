# BONEAMANITA v1.8.2: "The Quantum Leap (PATCHED)"

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.8.2 ("The Quantum Leap - Spore Patch") **Date:** 2025-12-21

> "The interference pattern between failure and genius is where the isotopes are hidden." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.8.2:** This version implements the **"Spore" Update**. It introduces **Spatial Logic** (allowing the system to detect geometry via prepositions), hardens memory persistence with **Atomic Saves**, and makes the Frequency Modulator smarter at hunting complex words.

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita182.py` (v1.8.2).
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Run the `_run_calibration_sequence` to verify integrity. Then, use the `BonepokeCore` logic to analyze my inputs."
    

### Method B: The Membrane (System Prompt)

_To enable the automatic time-tracking features, use the provided System Prompt._

1. **Copy** the System Prompt (which includes **The Membrane** protocol).
    
2. **Paste** it into the System Instructions or Custom Instructions field.
    
3. **Effect:** The Membrane will automatically calculate the time elapsed since your last message and inject it silently (`[Δt: 2h]`) into the engine.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.8.2)

### 0. The Spore Patch (Spatial Intelligence)

-   **The Architect Bias:** The Signature Engine now tracks **Spatial Density** (prepositions like *under, over, between*).
-   **The Gravity Well:** High spatial density artificially boosts **Structure** and dampens **Velocity**, guiding the system to correctly identify **THE ARCHITECT** archetype (High Structure / Low Velocity) even in short texts.
-   **The Benefit:** The system now recognizes that describing the *geometry* of a room is a structural act, not a passive one.

### 1. Atomic Persistence (Memory Hardening)

-   **The Upgrade:** Implemented a **Write-Then-Swap** protocol for `bone_memory.json` using `shutil`.
-   **The Fix:** If the script crashes mid-save (e.g., power loss), the memory file is no longer corrupted. Your history is safe.

### 2. The Smart Tuner (Cognitive Hunting)

-   **The Upgrade:** The Frequency Modulator (Clarence/Eloise/Yaga) no longer gives up if it can't find a specific "trigger word" in its list.
-   **The Logic:** It now falls back to targeting the **longest word** in your input.
-   **The Philosophy:** Complexity usually hides in the syllables.

### 3. Critical Repairs

-   **The Missing Wire:** Fixed a critical bug where the Physics Engine calculated `spatial_density` but failed to send it to the Signature Engine, which would have caused a crash.
-   **Linguistic Safety:** Further refined `smart_strip` to prevent the mutilation of short nouns (e.g., "Gas" -> "Ga").

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The Governance Layer (Tier 3 Logic)

**Feature:** Sets the "Laws of Physics" based on User Tier, Current Mandate, and Tags.

- **Draconian Mode:** If `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` is active, Logic Tears become fatal errors (+10.0 Voltage).
    
- **Dream Mode:** If `[DREAM]` is detected, Axiom constraints are explicitly lifted.
    

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (Analysis)

Measures the raw physics of the text.

-   **Spatial Scanner (New):** Tracks the density of geometric relationships (prepositions).
-   **Hydration Monitor:** Detects `CONCRETE`, `WATERY`, `FLOODED` (Fake), and `SWEATING` (High Effort).
-   **The BioHazard Filter:** A unified scanner that hunts `BLOAT` (Adverbs), `SILICA` (Synthetic Beige), and `MIRROR TRAPS` (Narcissism).

### 2. The Metabolic Reserve (Energy & Survival)

Tracks the **ATP** (Creative Energy) and **Isotopes** (Rare Earth).

- **The Isotope Centrifuge:** Converts Heavy Truths into currency.
    
- **The Flashpoint Protocol:** Detects high-speed insight ($T_a$). High Complexity + High Efficiency = **Infinite Flow** (+20 ATP).
    
- **The S_Salvage Loop:** Burns long-term memories for emergency fuel when starving.
    

### 3. The Signature Engine (Identity & Evolution)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP) and tracks **Geodesic Drift**.

- **Evolution Logic:** Monitors `arch_history` for consistency to trigger Tier 3 Identities (e.g., Inquisitor, Templar).
    
- **Smart Fusion:** Calculates Euclidean distance between archetypes for Hybrid states.
    

### 4. The Frequency Modulator (The Voices)

A tunable feedback system. Now supports **Signal Interference** (Paradox Radio) and **Smart Targeting** to critique the specific words dragging down your text.

### 5. The Temporal Dynamics Engine (Cognitive Speed)

Measures the **Rate of Insight** and **Depth of Memory**.

- **Insight Velocity ($\nabla\beta$):** Tracks the acceleration of Logic Tension. Rapid increases forgive Narrative Drag.
    
- **Rooting Depth ($\Xi$):** Forgives Abstraction if the user is citing ancient history (Deep Storage access).
    

### 6. The Chronos Anchor (Real Time)

Metabolizes **User Latency** and **Offline Drift**. Now triggers **Memory Cannibalization** during extended downtime.

### 7. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time)

Metabolizes **Narrative Velocity** into entropy tolerance. Determines if the _fiction_ is in **Montage** (High Entropy allowed) or **Bullet Time** (High Texture required).

### 8. The Memory System (Deep Storage & Persistence)

- **Hyphal Trace:** Short-term buffer (10 turns).
    
- **Deep Storage:** Long-term artifact vault. Supports **Cannibalization** (v1.7) and **Dreaming** (v1.8).
    
- **Persistence Manager:** Atomic file-based backup (`bone_memory.json`). Saves **Archetype History** and **Artifacts** safely.
    

### 9. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., _sun, prism, truth_) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP).

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Commands (Optional):**
    
    - `[DREAM]`: Disable logic enforcement for this turn.
        
    - `[FM: YAGA]`: Force "The Witch" to critique your hedging.
        
    - `[MODE: HARD]`: Switch to "Truth" mode permanently.
        
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Polychromatic HUD:** A color-coded readout of ATP (Energy), Drag (Weight), and Viscosity.
        
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your Archetype + **VSL-12D Vector Coordinates**.
        
    - **Dynamics:** Real-time scores for **Beta Friction** ($\beta$) and **Truth Acceleration** ($T_a$).
        
    - **Isotope Alerts:** Notifications if you have successfully mined a Heavy Truth.
        
    - **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
