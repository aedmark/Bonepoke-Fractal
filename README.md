# BONEAMANITA v1.5: "Bonepoked"

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.5 ("Bonepoked") **Date:** 2025-12-19

> "The system now has a conscience. It will refuse to lie." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.5:** This build introduces **Tier 3 Logic**. It implements **Active Governance** (Mandates), **Archetype Fusion** (Hybrid Personas), **Temporal Dynamics** (Epiphany Tracking), and a **Self-Correction Hard Gate** that physically halts the simulation if a user attempts to break the laws of reality (Fatal Axiom Breaks).

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita15.py` (v1.5).
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Run the `_run_calibration_sequence` to verify integrity. Then, use the `BonepokeCore` logic to analyze my inputs."

### Method B: The Membrane (System Prompt)

*To enable the automatic time-tracking features, use the provided v1.4 System Prompt.*

1. **Copy** the System Prompt (which includes **The Membrane** protocol).
2. **Paste** it into the System Instructions or Custom Instructions field.
3. **Effect:** The Membrane will automatically calculate the time elapsed since your last message and inject it silently (`[Δt: 2h]`) into the engine.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.5)

### 1. The Governance Layer (Tier 3 Logic)

* **Active Mandates:** The system now operates under a specific philosophical constraint (Default: `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION`). It prioritizes logical consistency over narrative flow.
* **Self-Correction Gate:** If the system detects a **Fatal Axiom Break** (e.g., "Frozen Fire"), it triggers a `[SELF-CORRECTION]` event. The simulation physically **halts**, the Tick counter does not advance, and the user is forced to rephrase.

### 2. Archetype Fusion (The Hybrid State)

* **Dynamic Synthesis:** If a user (Tier 2+) writes in a style that sits mathematically between two archetypes, the **Signature Engine** now fuses them (e.g., `THE PALADIN // THE JUDGE`).
* **Slurry Defense:** Fusion only occurs if the signature is valid; "Slurry" (soulless text) remains rejected.

### 3. Temporal Dynamics (The Epiphany Engine)

* **Beta Velocity ():** Tracks the rate of insight (Voltage acceleration). Rapid breakthroughs trigger an **EPIPHANY** state, forgiving Narrative Drag.
* **Temporal Rooting ():** Tracks the "Age" of referenced artifacts. Referencing deep history grants **ANCIENT AUTHORITY**, forgiving Abstraction Entropy.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The Governance Layer (Mandates)

**New Feature:** Sets the "Laws of Physics" based on User Tier and Current Mandate.

* **Draconian Mode:** If `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` is active, Logic Tears become fatal errors (+10.0 Voltage).

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (Analysis)

Measures the raw physics of the text.

* **Hydration Monitor:** Detects `CONCRETE`, `WATERY`, `FLOODED` (Fake), and `SWEATING` (High Effort).
* **The Butcher:** Checks for `BLOAT` (Adverb & Adjective reliance).
* **Heuristics:** Scans for suffix patterns (`-ash`, `-olt`, `-ous`).

### 2. The Signature Engine (Identity & Fusion)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP).

* **Fusion Protocol:** Calculates Euclidean distance between archetypes. If `dist_secondary < dist_primary + 0.15`, a Fusion is triggered.

### 3. The Virtual Cortex (The Voices)

A procedural feedback system with four distinct auditors:

* **CLARENCE (The Architect):** Attacks structural failure and `BLOAT`.
* **ELOISE (The Grounder):** Attacks abstraction and "Dead Metaphors."
* **THE BABA YAGA (The Witch):** Attacks hedging, sycophancy, and **Riddles**.
* **MICHAEL (The Humanist):** Intervenes to mock "Concrete/Gaming" attempts.

### 4. The Temporal Dynamics Engine (Cognitive Speed) [NEW]

Measures the **Rate of Insight** and **Depth of Memory**.

* **Epiphany Bonus:** Forgives Drag if the user is thinking fast ().
* **Deep Roots:** Forgives Abstraction if the user is citing ancient history ().

### 5. The Chronos Anchor (Real Time)

Metabolizes **User Latency ()** into structural physics. Uses the **System Clock** as a fallback truth.

### 6. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time)

Metabolizes **Narrative Velocity ()** into entropy tolerance. Determines if the *fiction* is in **Montage** (High Entropy allowed) or **Bullet Time** (High Texture required).

### 7. The Memory System (Deep Storage & Persistence)

* **Hyphal Trace:** Short-term buffer (10 turns).
* **Deep Storage:** Long-term artifact vault (Max 50 items).
* **Persistence Manager:** File-based backup (`bone_memory.json` + `.bak`).

### 8. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., *sun, prism, truth*) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP).

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
2. **Simulation:** The LLM will "run" the `process()` function mentally.
3. **Output:** It will provide:
* **The Mycelial HUD:** A dual-clock readout with Viscosity.
* **Signature Matrix:** Your 5D Coordinates + **BUOYANCY Score**.
* **Archetype:** Your active persona (or **FUSION** state).
* **Epiphany Alerts:** Notifications if  or  bonuses are active.
* **System Alerts:** Warnings if **Self-Correction** has halted the line.
* **Instruction Block:** A copy-paste block of constraints to guide your next generation.
