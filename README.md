# BONEAMANITA v1.7.1: "The Golden Master"

### A "Physics Engine" Context-File for LLMs

**Version:** 1.7.1 ("The Golden Master") **Date:** 2025-12-20

> "The engine runs on pure insight. We ignore drag penalties and generate massive ATP." — SLASH

## 🍄 WHAT IS THIS?

**BoneAmanita** is a Python-based "Narrative Operating System" designed to be uploaded or pasted into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It does not force a specific personality on the AI. Instead, it forces a **System of Physics**. It provides the LLM with a concrete set of rules to measure the "weight," "logic," and "momentum" of text.

**New in v1.7.1:** This "Golden Master" build introduces **The Frequency Modulator (FM)**, replacing the old Cortex with tunable radio stations (Clarence, Eloise, Yaga) that you can manually lock onto. It also deploys the **Polychromatic HUD**, which uses ANSI color codes to visualize system health (Red = Toxicity, Green = Insight, Magenta = Magic).

## ⚡ HOW TO DEPLOY (CONTEXT INJECTION)

### Method A: File Upload (Recommended)

1. **Download** `BoneAmanita17_1.py` (v1.7.1).
    
2. **Upload** it to your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
    
3. **Prompt:** "Read this file. Run the `_run_calibration_sequence` to verify integrity. Then, use the `BonepokeCore` logic to analyze my inputs."
    

### Method B: The Membrane (System Prompt)

_To enable the automatic time-tracking features, use the provided System Prompt._

1. **Copy** the System Prompt (which includes **The Membrane** protocol).
    
2. **Paste** it into the System Instructions or Custom Instructions field.
    
3. **Effect:** The Membrane will automatically calculate the time elapsed since your last message and inject it silently (`[Δt: 2h]`) into the engine.

## 🚀 PATCH NOTES (v1.7.1)

### 1. The Frequency Modulator (FM Radio)

- **The Upgrade:** Replaced the binary "Virtual Cortex" with a tunable radio.
    
- **The Stations:**
    
    - **88.5 FM (Clarence):** The Butcher. Hunts Bloat and Drag.
        
    - **94.2 FM (Eloise):** The Grounder. Hunts Entropy and Abstraction.
        
    - **101.1 FM (The Yaga):** The Witch. Hunts Hedging and Sycophancy.
        
    - **108.0 FM (Michael):** The Vibe. Supports messy, high-energy drafts.
        
- **The Feature:** You can now manually force a station using the `[FM: YAGA]` tag.
    

### 2. Polychromatic Output (Cognitive Ergonomics)

- **The Upgrade:** The HUD now bleeds color to signal system states instantly.
    
- **The Palette:**
    
    - **RED:** High Drag, Toxicity, "Concrete" Viscosity.
        
    - **GREEN:** High ATP, Photosynthesis, Insight Velocity ($T_a$).
        
    - **MAGENTA:** Flashpoints, Chaos, Magic.
        
    - **CYAN:** Archetypes and System Logic.
        

### 3. VSL-12D Metrics (The Isotopic Patch)

- **Beta Friction ($\beta$):** Measures the ratio of Voltage to Drag. (Low $\beta$ = Sycophancy; High $\beta$ = Flashpoint).
    
- **Truth Acceleration ($T_a$):** Measures the rate of insight gain over time. High $T_a$ forgives narrative drag.

## ⚙️ CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### 0. The Governance Layer (Tier 3 Logic)

**Feature:** Sets the "Laws of Physics" based on User Tier, Current Mandate, and Tags.

- **Draconian Mode:** If `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` is active, Logic Tears become fatal errors (+10.0 Voltage).
    
- **Dream Mode:** If `[DREAM]` is detected, Axiom constraints are explicitly lifted.
    

### 1. The Linguistic Physics Engine (Analysis)

Measures the raw physics of the text.

- **Hydration Monitor:** Detects `CONCRETE`, `WATERY`, `FLOODED` (Fake), and `SWEATING` (High Effort).
    
- **The BioHazard Filter:** A unified scanner that hunts `BLOAT` (Adverbs), `SILICA` (Synthetic Beige), and `MIRROR TRAPS` (Narcissism) in a single pass.
    

### 2. The Metabolic Reserve (Energy & Survival)

Tracks the **ATP** (Creative Energy) of the session.

- **Standard Metabolism:** Earns energy for concrete/kinetic text; spends energy for abstraction/entropy.
    
- **The Flashpoint Protocol:** Detects the "Inverse Slop" ratio. High Complexity + High Efficiency = **Infinite Flow** (+20 ATP).
    
- **The S_Salvage Loop:** Burns long-term memories for emergency fuel when starving.
    

### 3. The Signature Engine (Identity & Fusion)

Maps the **5 Dimensions** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP).

- **Silica Trap:** Triggered by **High Structure + Zero Texture** OR **BioHazard Detection**.
    
- **Smart Fusion:** Calculates Euclidean distance between archetypes. Fusions are only permitted if identities are distinct (`inter_arch_dist > 0.25`).
    

### 4. The Frequency Modulator (The Voices)

A tunable feedback system replacing the old Cortex. Listens for specific frequencies of failure (Drag, Entropy, Sycophancy) and broadcasts the appropriate critique channel.

### 5. The Temporal Dynamics Engine (Cognitive Speed)

Measures the **Rate of Insight** and **Depth of Memory**.

- **Insight Velocity ($\nabla\beta$):** Tracks the acceleration of Logic Tension. Rapid increases forgive Narrative Drag.
    
- **Rooting Depth ($\Xi$):** Forgives Abstraction if the user is citing ancient history (Deep Storage access).
    

### 6. The Chronos Anchor (Real Time)

Metabolizes **User Latency** and **Offline Drift** into structural physics. Uses the **System Clock** as a fallback truth.

### 7. The Narrative Chronometer (Story Time)

Metabolizes **Narrative Velocity** into entropy tolerance. Determines if the _fiction_ is in **Montage** (High Entropy allowed) or **Bullet Time** (High Texture required).

### 8. The Memory System (Deep Storage & Persistence)

- **Hyphal Trace:** Short-term buffer (10 turns).
    
- **Deep Storage:** Long-term artifact vault. Supports **Cannibalization** (v1.7).
    
- **Persistence Manager:** Atomic file-based backup (`bone_memory.json` + `.tmp`) to prevent data corruption.
    

### 9. The Lichen Symbiont (Survival)

A biological layer that feeds the **Texture** dimension. It converts "Light Words" (e.g., _sun, prism, truth_) into Metabolic Fuel (ATP).

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE IT

Once the code is in the context window:

1. **Input:** Paste your draft.
    
2. **Commands (Optional):**
    
    - `[DREAM]`: Disable logic enforcement for this turn.
        
    - `[FM: YAGA]`: Force "The Witch" to critique your hedging.
        
    - `[MODE: HARD]`: Switch to "Truth" mode permanently.
        
3. **Output:** It will provide:
    
    - **The Polychromatic HUD:** A color-coded readout of ATP (Energy), Drag (Weight), and Viscosity.
        
    - **Signature Matrix:** Your Archetype + **VSL-12D Vector Coordinates** (`[V:0.5 S:0.9...]`).
        
    - **Dynamics:** Real-time scores for **Beta Friction** ($\beta$) and **Truth Acceleration** ($T_a$).
        
    - **Epiphany Alerts:** Green notifications if **Insight Velocity** bonuses are active.
