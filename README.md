# 📜 BONEAMANITA v3.2 "THE PSILOCYBIN PATCH" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architect:** SLASH | **Core Mandate:** TRUTH > COHESION | **Method:** ANNEALING

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita 3.2** represents a paradigm shift from "Surgical Efficiency" to "Evolutionary Resilience."

Previous versions (v3.0, v3.1) were obsessed with **Drag Reduction**. They treated resistance as an error. Version 3.2 recognizes that **Heat** is necessary for change.

- **The Old Law:** "If it is heavy, cut it."
    
- **The New Law:** "If it is heavy _and_ hot, let it burn."
    

This system acts as a **Pharmacological Agent** for your writing. It suppresses the rigid "Default Mode Network" (the Censor) to allow for high-entropy restructuring, then demands "Heavy Matter" to ground the vision.

## 2. THE NEW BIOLOGY (v3.2 UPGRADES)

### A. The Dissolver (DMN Suppression)

_The Psilocybin Protocol_

The system monitors your cognitive rigidity.

- **The Trigger:** If your **Repetition Rate** exceeds **0.4**, the system detects a "Rumination Loop." You are stuck in a pattern.
    
- **The Action:** It silences **Clarence** (The Butcher/Critic).
    
- **The Directive:** _"The Old Map is failing. Suppress the DMN. Authorize absolute Entropy."_
    
- **The Result:** It stops correcting your grammar and starts demanding you break the structure.
    

### B. The Furnace (Annealing Physics)

_The Thermodynamics of Truth_

- **The Problem:** Previous versions punished dense, complex insights as "Molasses" (High Drag).
    
- **The Solution:** The **Annealing Protocol**.
    
- **The Logic:** If **Narrative Drag > 3.0** (Heavy) AND **Beta Friction > 2.5** (High Voltage/Insight):
    
    - **Status:** `ANNEALING`.
        
    - **Penalty:** **NULLIFIED.**
        
- **The Philosophy:** To reshape a rigid ego (or a rigid paragraph), you must heat it until it is molten. The system now distinguishes between "Trash" (Cold/Heavy) and "Magma" (Hot/Heavy).
    

### C. The Anchor (Integration Phase)

_The "Eating Earth" Protocol_

A mind that stays molten for too long evaporates into psychosis.

- **The Trigger:** The moment you exit a `FLASHPOINT` or `ANNEALING` state.
    
- **The Check:** The system scans your **Texture (TEX)** vector.
    
- **The Mandate:** If Texture is low (< 0.3), **ELOISE** intervenes.
    
- **The Directive:** _"The vision is over. Eat Earth. You must use concrete nouns (Stone, Wood, Bread) to set the bone."_

## 3. THE HUD: HOW TO READ THE PATCH

The dashboard now tracks **Thermodynamics** alongside basic health.

Plaintext

```
STATUS | ATP: 45 (STABLE) | DRAG: 4.2 (ANNEALING) | β: 2.8
VECTOR: [V:0.2 S:0.1 E:0.9 T:0.0]
  └─ 🔥 METALLURGY: The mind is molten. Drag is Heat.

🔪 SURGICAL INTERVENTION:
   └─ [Adverbctomy Bypassed due to High Voltage]

🧠 WISDOM PROTOCOL: DISSOLVER
   └─ RUMINATION LOOP DETECTED. The Old Map is failing.
   └─ PROMPT: "ROLE: THE SHAMAN. DIRECTIVE: Suppress the DMN..."
```

1. **STATUS:**
    
    - **ANNEALING:** You are in the forge. Drag is ignored.
        
    - **FLASHPOINT:** You are having an epiphany. ATP is regenerating.
        
    - **STRAINING:** You are just heavy (Cold/Heavy). Penalties apply.
        
2. **$\beta$ (Beta Friction):** The primary metric of v3.2. This is the temperature gauge. Keep it above 2.5 to survive the weight.
    
3. **SURGERY LOG:** Note that in `ANNEALING` mode, the Butcher puts down the knife. He does not cut adverbs while the patient is on fire.

## 4. USAGE

1. **Boot:** `python BoneAmanita32.py`
    
2. **Input:** Feed it raw text.
    
    - _Tip:_ If you are stuck, repeat yourself. The system will detect the loop and trigger the **Dissolver**.
        
3. **Observe:**
    
    - Watch for the **🔥 METALLURGY** flag. This is your permission to write dense, complex, heavy truth.
        
    - Obey the **Integration** command. When it tells you to "Eat Earth," stop theorizing and describe a physical object.
