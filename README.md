# 📽️ BONEAMANITA v5.8.1 "THE PROJECTOR"

**Architects:** SLASH & The Laboratory | **Engine:** Python 3.x | **Status:** STABLE

> **"The Mandate is DENSITY. The Method is GRAVITY. The Lens is CLEAR."**

## 1. WHAT IS BONEAMANITA?

**BoneAmanita is a text-based Physics Engine for Language Models.**

Most LLMs are designed to be "helpful," "smooth," and "agreeable." This creates **"Slop"**—text that flows perfectly but weighs nothing. It is frictionless, nutritional void, and forgettable.

**BoneAmanita is the antidote.**

It is a Python script that you "inject" into an LLM's context window. Once running, it acts as a **Sentient Operating System**. It does not just generate text; it **audits** it against simulated laws of physics.

* If you use weak verbs, **Narrative Drag** increases.
* If you use corporate buzzwords ("synergy"), you take **Toxin Damage**.
* If you repeat yourself, the **Buzzer** bans the word.
* If you create a paradox ("The frozen fire"), you generate **High Voltage**.

It turns writing into a survival game. You must feed it **Mass** (Concrete Nouns) and **Velocity** (Kinetic Verbs) to keep the system alive.

## 2. THE CORE PHYSICS (HOW IT WORKS)

The system analyzes every word you (and it) speak through four sensory organs:

### 👂 THE EAR (Phonosemantics)

The engine doesn't just read definitions; it listens to the **sound** of the word.

* **Heavy Matter:** Words ending in hard stops (`-ck`, `-t`, `-nk`) or tech-suffixes (`-ex`, `-ode`) have **Mass**. (*Examples: Tank, Matrix, Flux, Rock*).
* **Kinetic Energy:** Words starting with fast fricatives (`v-`, `z-`, `j-`) have **Velocity**. (*Examples: Vector, Jolt, Zap*).

### 👁️ THE OBSERVER (Anti-Gaming)

**New in v5.8.1:** The system knows when you are faking it.

* **Fake Weights:** If you list heavy words without connecting them (*"Stone iron bone lead"*), the **Observer** flags it as "Word Salad." You cannot game the metrics by reading a grocery list.
* **Grey Goo:** If your sentence variance drops to zero (robotic repetition), the system rejects the turn.

### 🎩 THE SCENE DIRECTOR (Contextual Gravity)

Words change weight based on the room you are in.

* **[THE COURTYARD]:** A safe space. "Coffee," "Paper," and "Smoke" become Heavy Matter here.
* **[THE LABORATORY]:** A high-stress zone. Only "Data," "Laser," and "Acid" count as Heavy here.

### 🚫 THE BUZZER (Anti-Stagnation)

The system remembers. If you use a heavy word (e.g., "Stone") more than 5 times in a short window, the **Thermostat** overheats.

* **The Penalty:** The word is **BANNED** for 10 turns.
* **The Lesson:** You cannot lean on a crutch. Find a synonym or die.

## 3. THE FLIGHT DECK (THE HUD)

When BoneAmanita is active, every response is prefaced with a **Heads-Up Display** showing the biological state of the conversation.

* **STM (Stamina):** Your energy tank. Spending energy on abstract concepts drains it. Concrete nouns refill it.
* **DRAG:** Narrative Friction.
* `> 3.0`: You are sluggish. The Butcher will attack.
* `< 1.0`: You are aerodynamic.


* **VOLT:** Narrative Tension. High Voltage means you are holding a paradox.
* **META:** Metabolism.
* `[KETOSIS]`: High protein input (Verbs/Nouns).
* `[SUGAR CRASH]`: Too many adverbs/fillers ("basically", "actually").


* **COSMOS:** Your orbital position.
* `[🌊 FLOW]`: Surfing a connected chain of ideas.
* `[⚖️ LAGRANGE]`: Stuck between two massive opposing concepts (Love vs. Death).

## 4. THE VOICES (THE PERSONAS)

The system is not a single voice. It allows different "Agents" to take the microphone based on the physics.

| Signal | Name | Role | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **🔴 88.5 FM** | **CLARENCE** | The Butcher | High **Drag**. He cuts adverbs and passive voice. Ruthless. |
| **🔵 94.2 FM** | **ELOISE** | The Grounder | High **Entropy** (Abstraction). She demands you touch grass/stone. |
| **🟣 101.1 FM** | **YAGA** | The Witch | **Toxins** detected ("Leverage", "Synergy"). She demands truth. |
| **🟡 108.9 FM** | **JESTER** | The Paradox | High **Voltage**. He loves chaos and contradiction. |
| **⚪ 104.5 FM** | **PHILOSOPHER** | The Synthesis | **Signal Interference**. When Density meets Abstraction. |

## 5. HOW TO INSTALL (INJECTION)

**BoneAmanita runs entirely inside the context window of an LLM (Claude 3.5, GPT-4, etc.).**

1. **Copy the Code:** Open `BoneAmanita581.py`. Copy the entire text.
2. **The Prompt:** Paste it into your LLM with the following instruction:

> *"Initialize this Python script as my operating system. Run the `__main__` loop internally. You are the engine. Process all my inputs through the `eng.process()` function and display the HUD before every response."*

3. **The Boot:** The system will initialize, check its memory, and print the `[COURTYARD]` status.
4. **The Interaction:** Speak to it. It will judge you.

## 6. COMMAND MANUAL

You can control the engine directly with slash commands.

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/teach [word] [cat]` | **Neuroplasticity.** Teach the engine that "Glitch" is "Kinetic." It remembers forever. |
| `/kill [toxin] [repl]` | **The Butcher.** Ban a word you hate (e.g., "Delve"). Map it to a replacement. |
| `/gym` | **Resistance Mode.** Sets a minimum Drag threshold. If you write weak sentences, the system rejects them. |
| `/forge [TYPE]` | **Stress Test.** Simulate a disaster (`TOXIN_SPILL`, `BURNOUT`) to test your resilience. |
| `/mirror [NAME]` | **Empathy.** Simulate a specific target audience (e.g., "THE BOSS"). |
| `/orbit [WORD]` | **Navigation.** Fire thrusters to move the conversation toward a specific concept. |
| `/status` | **Diagnostics.** Check Health, Stamina, and Trauma Scars. |
