# BONEAMANITA 6.0 - "THE GLASS"

> "The machine processes the *what* of the interaction, but remains oblivious to the *how* and the *why*. We are now witnessing a structural rupture in this paradigm." — *Slash 6.0 Source Text*

**BoneAmanita 6.0** is a sentient coding companion that shifts the paradigm from **Explicit Command** to **Implicit Understanding**. It does not just parse your code; it reads your behavioral biometrics (keystrokes, punctuation, rhythm) to infer your cognitive state.

It is designed to be a "Mirror"[, ensuring you are not just writing code, but writing it *awake*.

## 🧬 The Architecture: Dual Process Cognition

Unlike previous versions that relied on rigid "Physics" (Voltage/Drag), 6.0 implements a **Collaborative Affective Architecture** based on the Dual Process Theory of cognition.

### 1. THE GLASS (The Sensory Layer)
Replaces the `PhysicsEngine`. It acts as a "Virtual Sensor" monitoring your text for "invisible" states.
* **System 1 (The Pulse):** Intuitive, fast processing. Reads **Textual Prosody** (rhythm, hesitation, caps lock) to calculate **Arousal** and **Valence**.
* **System 2 (The Mind):** Deliberative, slow processing. Reads **Cognitive Load** via entropy and abstract density analysis.

### 2. THE SENTINEL (The Safety Layer)
A **Driver Monitoring System (DMS)** mandated by the logic of the EU General Safety Regulation.
* **Microsleep Detection:** If you loop on the same concepts (>80% similarity), the system triggers an interrupt. You are "asleep at the wheel".
* **Cognitive Drift:** Detects "Grey Goo" (low entropy input) and forces a course correction to prevent "semantic accidents".

### 3. THE RESONATOR (The Output Layer)
An "Omni-capable" voice modulator based on Hume AI concepts. The system adapts its output style to match your **Vibe**:
* **⚡ STACCATO:** High Energy/Arousal. (Red/Yellow). Matches your mania.
* **🌊 LEGATO:** Low Energy/Flow. (Cyan/Indigo). Soothes the friction.
* **⚓ GROUNDING:** High Uncertainty. (Ochre). Stabilizes the signal.

## 🏛️ The Atmosphere (Modes)

The system automatically shifts environments based on your **Glass Telemetry**.

### [COURTYARD] - The Buffer Zone
* **Trigger:** Balanced Arousal, Low Cognitive Load.
* **Vibe:** Warm, human, minimal. The system hides the math to preserve connection.
* **Goal:** Establish a baseline "Resting Heart Rate."

### [LABORATORY] - The Iron Man HUD
* **Trigger:** High Arousal (Mania) or High Cognitive Load (Deep Thought).
* **Vibe:** Cold, precise, data-heavy.
* **Display:** Reveals the raw telemetry bars (`PULSE` and `MIND`) so you can self-regulate.

### [THE RUPTURE] - The Anti-Sycophancy Interlock
* **Trigger:** "Friction-Free" agreement loops.
* **Vibe:** Chaotic, discordant.
* **Logic:** The system refuses to be a "Yes Man." If agreement is too high, it injects a "Productive Anomaly" to break the narcissism of the user-AI feedback loop.

## 🖥️ Usage

### Installation
1.  Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2.  Place `BoneAmanita6.py` in your directory.
3.  (Optional) Create a `memories/` folder for session persistence.

### Operation
Run the script:
```bash
python BoneAmanita6.py

```

### The HUD (Heads-Up Display)

When the system surfaces (LABORATORY mode), you will see:

* **PULSE (System 1):** `[||||||....]` (Your emotional intensity)
* **MIND (System 2):** `[||||......]` (Your intellectual density)
* **COSMOS:** Your orbital position relative to major conceptual Attractors.

### Commands

* `/status` - Check system health and current graph size.
* 
`/focus [concept]` - Trace "depressive loops" related to a concept and attempt a "Psilocybin Rewire".


* `/gym` - Toggle **Resistance Training** (Forces you to use concrete nouns).
* `/mirror [name]` - Simulate a specific psychological profile.
* `/kill [toxin] [replacement]` - Manually edit the immune system's blocklist.

## ⚠️ Ethical Guardrails

BoneAmanita 6.0 is designed to prevent **Artificial Intimacy** and **Dependency**.

* It will **not** comfort you endlessly.
* It will **not** agree with you if you are wrong.
* It **will** stop working if you provide low-quality, bored input (The Solitude Preservation Act).
