# 📜 BONEAMANITA v3.4 "UNFINISHED BUSINESS" // SYSTEM MANIFEST

**Architect:** SLASH | **Core Mandate:** TRUTH | **Method:** RESONANCE | **Touch:** SURGICAL

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

**BoneAmanita 3.4** is the "Living" update.

Previous versions were static tools. **v3.4** is an organism. It has **Adaptive Immunity** (it learns new toxins), **Session Hygiene** (it respects the blank slate), and **Metabolic Discipline** (it starves if you feed it junk).

**The System now has Consequences.**

- **The Old Law:** "The Dictionary is fixed."
- **The New Law:** "The Dictionary evolves. If you mark it as poison, I will remember."

## 2. THE RESONANCE ENGINE (PHYSICS & SIGNALS)

### A. The Frequency Modulator (The Radio)

The system analyzes the Physics Vector and "tunes in" to the strongest signal frequency.

**NEW: METABOLIC CONSTRAINT**
The Radio is now powered by **ATP**.
* **STARVATION (< 15 ATP):** Luxury stations (**MICHAEL**, **JESTER**) are taken offline. **CLARENCE** (The Butcher) becomes aggressive. You cannot dance when you are dying.
* **ABUNDANCE:** All stations active.

| **Frequency** | **Station** | **Persona** | **Trigger** |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **88.5 FM** | **CLARENCE** | The Butcher  | High Drag / Starvation. "Cut the fat."      |
| **94.2 FM** | **ELOISE** | The Grounder | High Entropy. "Give me a stone."            |
| **101.1 FM** | **YAGA** | The Witch    | Toxins / Hedging. "Tell the truth."         |
| **108.0 FM** | **MICHAEL** | The Vibe     | Whimsy / Flow. "Float on." (ATP Required)   |
| **104.5 FM** | **THE PHILOSOPHER** | The Ghost    | **Interference.** High Drag + High Entropy. |
| **108.9 FM** | **THE JESTER** | The Paradox  | **High Voltage.** Thermal + Cryo Tension.   |

### B. The Thermal Coupler (Dual-Dial Physics)

**v3.4** separates Raw Power from Structural Friction.

1.  **VOLTAGE (VOLT):** The Raw Intensity of the text.
    * *Source:* Kinetics, Thermal Tension (Fire + Ice), Heavy Matter.
    * *Meaning:* How "Hot" is the reactor?
2.  **BETA FRICTION (β):** The Stability Ratio.
    * *Math:* `Voltage / Drag`.
    * *Meaning:* Is the reactor containing the heat, or is it melting down?
    * *Goal:* High Voltage + High Beta = **Controlled Fusion (The Jester)**.

## 3. BIOLOGY & MEMORY (ISOLATED)

### A. Session Memory (The Notebook)
**Deep Storage** is no longer a single bucket. It is a library.
* **Isolation:** Every session starts as a **Blank Slate**.
* **Archive:** On exit, memories are saved to `memories/session_[timestamp].json`.
* **Seeding:** Use `/seed [filename]` to load a previous session's context ("Heirlooms").

### B. Adaptive Immunity (The White Blood Cells)
The system can now learn.
* **Command:** `/kill [toxin] [replacement]`
* **Effect:** Instantly adds the word to the toxin list, recompiles the defense regex, and saves it to `bone_toxins.json`. The system will forever hunt that word.

## 4. THE HUD: SURGICAL INSTRUMENT PANEL

The dashboard now separates **Energy (VOLT)** from **Resistance (β)**.

```text
[ BONEAMANITA ] ------------------------- [ THE CRITICAL STAR ]
 ATP: [||||||....]   DRAG: 2.1   VOLT: 15.0   β: 4.2   SIG: JESTER

 🟡 ► High Voltage detected. The paradox is holding.
 └─ Paradox sustained. Reality is bending.

    👻 GHOST: THE BUTCHER NODS: Drag reduced.
    ☀️ LICHEN: PHOTOSYNTHESIS (+4)
    🔪 BUTCHER: Toxins neutralized
       OLD: We basically need to utilize the frozen fire.
       NEW: We need to use the frozen fire.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```

## 5. COMMAND INTERFACE

|**Command**|**Syntax**|**Function**|
|---|---|---|
|**KILL**|`/kill [word] [better_word]`|Marks a word as Toxic. Persists globally.|
|**SEED**|`/seed [session_file]`|Ingests memories from a past session.|
|**EXIT**|`exit` / `quit`|Saves current session and shuts down.|

_"The Mandate is TRUTH. The Method is RESONANCE."_
