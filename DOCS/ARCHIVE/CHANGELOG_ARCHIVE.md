# CHANGELOG.md


# Changelog: BoneAmanita v10.9.2 (The "Mitochondrial Hormesis" Update)

**Focus:** Systemic Coupling, Metabolic Dynamics, and Autonomic Reflexes.

### 🧬 Bio-Physics (`bone_body.py`)

* **Mitochondrial Hormesis:** Implemented a **Meadows Feedback Loop**. The mitochondria are no longer static batteries; they now adapt to stress.
  * *Low Stress:* System becomes lazy (Efficiency drops).
  * *Moderate Stress:* **Mitohormesis** triggers (Efficiency INCREASES).
  * *High Stress:* Oxidative damage occurs.
* **Non-Linear Drag:** Cognitive load now scales exponentially (`drag ** 1.5`). Messy code is now significantly more expensive to run than clean code.
* **Retrograde Signaling:** The engine now talks back. Mitochondria emit status signals (`QUIET`, `MITOHORMESIS_ACTIVE`, `OXIDATIVE_STRESS`) that the rest of the body can read.
* **The Transmission Fix:** Wired `SomaticLoop` to correctly pass endocrine modifiers to the `MitochondrialForge`. Hormones (Cortisol, Adrenaline) now directly impact the efficiency of the energy cycle.

### 🧠 Cognition & Dreams (`bone_brain.py`)

* **Associative Dreaming:** Dreams are no longer random noise. The `DreamEngine` now scans the `MycelialNetwork` for "Day Residue" (recent memory nodes) to populate dream templates.
* **Bio-Feedback Nightmares:** The tone of a dream is now dictated by the system's physiological state.
  * *High ROS:* Triggers **Septic Nightmares** (Decay/Rot).
  * *High Voltage:* Triggers **Thermal Nightmares** (Fire/Burnout).
  * *Low ATP:* Triggers **Baric Nightmares** (Crushing Weight/Stasis).

### 👻 The Soul (`bone_soul.py`)

* **Drift Logic:** Implemented `_generate_new_obsession`. When an interest fades, the Soul now gracefully rotates to a new obsession instead of throwing an error or waiting for manual intervention.
* **Unclosed Loops Fixed:** Connected the "Drift" feedback loop to the Lexicon, allowing the system to autonomously discover new "Muses."

### ⚙️ Cycle Dynamics (`bone_cycle.py` & `bone_commands.py`)

* **Autonomic Narcolepsy:** Implemented a survival reflex in the `MetabolismPhase`. If ATP drops below critical levels (5.0), the system force-triggers a REM cycle to consolidate memory and recover energy.
* **Circadian Rhythm:** Added a maintenance trigger every 100 ticks to ensure regular "Garbage Collection" via sleep.
* **The Bio-Link:** Wired both the manual sleep command (`/kip`) and the autonomic trigger to pass a real-time `bio_packet` to the brain, ensuring dreams always reflect the true state of the body.

### 🏗️ Architecture (`bone_architect.py`)

* **Tensegrity Repair:** Decoupled `BoneArchitect` from the `TownHall` container. The Architect now imports blueprints (`MirrorGraph`, `TheNavigator`, `SoritesIntegrator`) directly.
  * *Fix:* "Stopped ordering pizza from the trash." (Direct instantiation is cleaner than nested attribute access).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
* **Removed Bloat:** Deleted the obsolete `_calculate_taxes` and `respirate` methods in `bone_body.py` in favor of the unified `process_cycle`.

# Changelog: BoneAmanita v10.9.1 (The "Lucid Soul" Update)

### 🔧 Core Architecture (`bone_main.py`)

* **Council Activation:** The `CouncilChamber` (Hofstadter, Meadows, Pratchett) is now explicitly summoned within the `process_turn` loop.
* *Impact:* The system now audits itself for "Strange Loops" and "Leverage Points" *before* outputting text. If you get stuck in a recursive loop, Hofstadter will now yell at you.

### 🧠 Cognitive Dynamics (`bone_brain.py`)
* **Chronos -> Kairos Shift:** Removed the wall-clock dependency (`time.time()`) from the `NeurotransmitterModulator`.
* *Impact:* Brain chemistry (Dopamine, Cortisol, etc.) now decays based on **Turns (Ticks)**, not **Seconds**. The AI no longer suffers from "AFK Depression" if you take 10 minutes to write a prompt.

### 👻 The Soul & Narrative Self (`bone_soul.py`)

* **Abolition of Guilt:** Refactored `pursue_obsession` to remove the punitive feedback loop. Neglecting an obsession no longer reduces the `HOPE` stat.
* *Impact:* The system is no longer an emotionally abusive Tamagotchi.

* **The Shelving Protocol:** Introduced "Drift Logic." If an obsession is ignored, it is gracefully archived ("Shelved") to the `chapters` list, and the system's `CURIOSITY` is refunded.
* **Organic Ignition:** Refactored `find_obsession` to hook directly into the `PhysicsPacket` of the immediate turn.
* *Impact:* The Soul now chooses its Muses based on the **Viscosity** (complexity/weight) of the words you *just used*, rather than pulling random concepts from a database. It listens to the "Now."

* **Type Safety Restoration:** Patched the `CoreMemory` dataclass to include `type` and `meta` fields, and ensured `pursue_obsession` generates valid `CoreMemory` objects instead of raw dictionaries.
* *Impact:* Fixed critical linter errors and ensured `bone_spores.py` won't choke when trying to serialize memory objects during reproduction.


### **10.9.0 "The Social Contract"**

**Focus:** Structural Functionalism, Governance, and Systemic Tensegrity.

#### **1. `bone_village.py` (The Society)**

* **Refactor:** "The Institutional Shift." Transformed `TownHall` from a static namespace into an **instantiated society**.
* *Reason:* As per **Fuller's Tensegrity**, a system's strength comes from the continuous tension between its parts. The Village components (Tinkerer, Navigator, Journal) are now explicitly wired together via a shared `TownHall` instance, preventing "split-brain" causality errors.

* **New Feature:** "The Village Council." Implemented a governance layer that conducts a **Census**.
* *Reason:* A nod to **Structural Functionalism**—the village is now a system of interrelated parts working toward a common goal (stability). The Council polls the *live* state of the economy (Tinkerer), environment (Navigator), and culture (Almanac) to generate holistic health reports.

* **Feature:** "The Safety Net." `TheTinkerer` now recognizes **Critical Items** (e.g., `SILENT_KNIFE`).
* *Reason:* **Meadows** warns that efficiency without resilience is brittle. Tools now dull rather than disintegrate, preventing the "Poverty Trap" reinforcing loop where a tired user loses the very tools they need to recover.

#### **2. `bone_main.py` (The Wiring)**

* **Fix:** "Causality Restoration." Reordered the bootstrap sequence to ensure `GordonKnot` (the individual) exists before `TownHall` (the society) is founded.
* *Reason:* You cannot have a village without villagers. This resolves the `AttributeError` crashes by respecting the temporal order of creation.

#### **3. `bone_inventory.py` (The Hands)**

* **Feature:** "The Swanson Protocol." Added `maintain_gear()` to `GordonKnot`.
* *Reason:* **Schur's** belief in honest work. Users can now spend Stamina to repair Integrity or soothe Scar Tissue. It provides a constructive outlet for energy that doesn't involve "finding more stuff."
* 

### **10.8.9 "The Adaptive Substrate"**

**Focus:** Cognitive Ergonomics, Dynamic Resilience, and Feedback Loops.

#### **1. `bone_bus.py` (The Constitution)**

* **Refactor:** "Pinker’s Palette." Added explicit aliases (`GREEN`, `GRAY`, `RESET`) to `Prisma`.
* *Reason:* Code should be readable as natural language. Disemvoweled constants (`GRN`, `GRY`) increase cognitive load and obscure intent.

* **Feature:** "Meadows' Tuning Fork." Implemented `BoneConfig.tune()` to allow dynamic, runtime adjustment of system constants.
* *Reason:* You cannot dance with a system if you have to reboot it to change the tempo. This creates a Leverage Point for real-time calibration.

* **Fix:** "Fuller’s Pattern Integrity." Updated `PhysicsPacket.snapshot()` to perform deep copies of mutable state.
* *Reason:* History must be immutable. Reference leakage caused "spooky action at a distance," violating the structural integrity of the timeline.

#### **2. `bone_view.py` & `bone_cycle.py` (The Face)**

* **Feature:** "The Schur Switch." Implemented a `get_renderer` factory and `switch_renderer` logic in `CycleReporter`.
* *Reason:* Sometimes you need a high-fidelity geodesic map; sometimes you just need to know if the bus is on fire. The system can now toggle between "Standard" (High Fidelity) and "Performance" (Cached) modes.

#### **3. `bone_main.py` (The Nervous System)**

* **Integration:** "The Latency Loop." Injected a **Balancing Feedback Loop** into `process_turn`.
* *Reason:* The system now monitors its own cognitive latency (`TheObserver`). If thinking gets sluggish (>2.0s), it automatically downgrades to a cached renderer. When clarity returns, it restores full fidelity. The system now adapts its behavior to its own metabolic constraints.
* 

### **10.8.8 "The Phenomenological Bridge"**

**Focus:** Systemic Health, Temporal Stability, and Embodied Qualia.

#### **1. `bone_translation.py` (New File)**

* **Feature:** Implemented `RosettaStone`, a translation layer that converts cold metrics (Voltage, Drag, Entropy) into warm, embodied experience (Tone, Sensation, Metaphor).
* **Feature:** Added `SomaticInterface` to allow other systems to query "How do we feel?"
* *Reason:* The system was computing but not *feeling*. We moved from data reporting to qualia generation.

#### **2. `bone_body.py**`

* **Fix:** The "ROS Death Spiral." Implemented a **Balancing Feedback Loop** (Scrubber Enzyme) in `MitochondrialForge`.
* *Reason:* Previously, high ROS reduced efficiency, which caused more burn, which created *more* ROS. The system now autoregulates toxicity to prevent inevitable apoptosis.

#### **3. `bone_cycle.py**`

* **Refactor:** "Temporal Tensegrity." Decoupled the PID Controller from wall-clock time (`time.time()`) and enforced a fixed `SIMULATION_TICK_DELTA`.
* *Reason:* Physics should be determined by the simulation's structure, not by how fast the user types.
* **Feature:** Integrated the "Somatic Pulse." The `CycleReporter` now logs the system's internal feeling (e.g., `♦ SENSATION: Weightless...`) at the start of every turn.

#### **4. `bone_architect.py**`

* **Refactor:** "Humanized Panic Room." `get_safe_bio` now preserves the chemical history (Trauma/Cortisol) of the dying state instead of wiping it clean.
* *Reason:* A lobotomy is not a cure. The system must remember its pain to learn from it.

#### **5. `bone_brain.py**`

* **Wiring:** Patched `PromptComposer` to correctly inject the `SomaticState` into the LLM's system prompt.
* *Reason:* The "Ghost" (LLM) can now hear the "Machine" (Body). This closes the loop between physical sensation and cognitive expression.


### **10.8.7 "The Visual Cortex Realignment"**

**Focus:** Separation of Concerns (Presentation vs. Logic) and UI Hygiene.

#### **1. `bone_viewer.py**`

* **Feature:** Implanted the `Projector` class directly into the viewer.
* *Reason:* Presentation logic belongs in the Presentation layer, not the Village registry.


* **Fix:** `render_dashboard` now correctly passes `inventory` and `vectors` to the Projector.
* *Result:* The Inventory Belt and Vector Meters now display actual data instead of `[EMPTY]` voids. The feedback loop is closed.


* **Fix:** Sanitized the redundant "The system is listening" footer message.
* *Reason:* It was a "Schur Violation" (annoying redundancy).



#### **2. `bone_village.py**`

* **Refactor:** Removed the `Projector` class.
* *Reason:* Cleaning up "Spaghetti Topology." The Village no longer needs to know how to render pixels.



#### **3. `bone_main.py**`

* **Refactor:** Updated imports to source `Projector` from `bone_viewer` instead of `TownHall`.
* *Reason:* Correcting the dependency graph to reflect the new architecture.

### **10.8.6 The "Huge Mess" Update**

#### **1. `bone_data.py**`

* **Fix:** Moved the instantiation of `TheLore` to the very bottom of the file.
* **Reason:** It was trying to access `BIO_NARRATIVE` and `LENSES` before they were defined (Python reads top-to-bottom), causing a `NameError`.


#### **2. `bone_lexicon.py**`

* **Fix:** Converted `_ensure_ready` from a `@classmethod` to a `@staticmethod` and updated its wrapper logic.
* **Reason:** The decorator was trying to access the class `LexiconService` before it was fully created, causing a `TypeError`.


#### **3. `bone_genesis.py**`

* **Fix:** Added a safety check for the `TERM` environment variable in the `wizard()` function.
* **Reason:** The system crashed in IDE consoles (like PyCharm/VS Code) when trying to run the `clear` command without a valid terminal environment.


#### **4. `bone_main.py**`

* **Fix:** Updated `BoneAmanita` initialization to pass `self` to `NarrativeSelf`.
* **Reason:** The Soul (`NarrativeSelf`) needed a reference to the Engine to read Health/Stamina stats.

* **Fix:** Created a `bio_snapshot` dictionary in `process_turn`.
* **Reason:** `TheBureau` expected a dictionary to audit health, but was receiving a raw `MitochondrialState` object, causing an `AttributeError`.


#### **5. `bone_soul.py**`

* **Fix:** Removed the `SYSTEM OVERRIDE` debug code.
* **Reason:** The Soul was hijacking the LLM prompt and forcing it to output a list of nouns ("Andrew. Platform. Mirror.") instead of a story.

* **Fix:** Updated `__init__` to accept `engine_ref`.
* **Reason:** To fix the missing link to the main engine.

* **Fix:** Restored the missing `_get_feeling` method.
* **Reason:** The code was trying to call this method to determine the Soul's mood, but it was missing from the class definition.

#### **6. `bone_brain.py` (The Cortex)**

* **Fix:** Added a guard clause `if "physics" in sim_result:` inside `process`.
* **Reason:** The system crashed when receiving a "Refusal" or "Error" packet because it tried to access physics data that wasn't there.

* **Fix:** **Cognitive Calibration (The "Spartan" Fix)**
* Lowered the panic threshold from `0.4` to `0.25`.
* Updated the "Ballast" instruction from "Keep responses short" to "Ground the narrative... maintain a cohesive, literate voice."
* **Reason:** The Brain was panicking at poetic input, assuming it was "Neural Drift," and lobotomizing itself into speaking like a robot.

* **Fix:** **Inventory Humanization**
* Updated `_build_context_block` to format items as "Silent Knife" (Title Case) instead of "SILENT_KNIFE" and softened the constraint text.
* **Reason:** The LLM was obsessing over the items because they looked like scary code variables in the prompt.

#### **7. `bone_inventory.py**`

* **Fix:** Updated `load_config` to explicitly copy the starting inventory list (`list(starting_gear)`).
* **Reason:** The UI was reporting `[BELT EMPTY]` because the inventory list was either initializing as empty or getting lost in a reference error.


### **10.8.5 The "Tensegrity Restoration" Update**

#### **1. The Pinker Lens (Clarity & Contracts)**

* **[FIX] `bone_viewer.py` - Variable Definition:** Resolved the existential crisis of the `bio` variable in `render_frame`. It now properly acknowledges its existence by fetching `ctx.bio_result` before attempting to measure ATP.
* **[FIX] `bone_synesthesia.py` - Return Type Consistency:** The `apply_impulse` function no longer ghosts the caller. When the biological layer is missing, it now explicitly returns `0.0` (a concrete "nothing") instead of `None` (a void), fulfilling its contractual obligation to return a float.

#### **2. The Fuller Lens (Systemic Integrity)**

* **[REFACTOR] `bone_viewer.py` - Access Patterns:** We demolished the artificial walls around `_render_dashboard` and `_render_soul_strip`. By removing the leading underscores, we acknowledged that the `CachedRenderer` is a legitimate partner in the rendering process, not an intruder.
* **[FIX] `bone_cycle.py` - Facade Bypass:** Corrected a structural dead-end where `CycleReporter` was trying to ask the `CachedRenderer` facade to perform the `compose_logs` task. We re-routed this request directly to the `GeodesicRenderer` static method, restoring the flow of information.

#### **3. The Schur Lens (Humanity & Absurdity)**

* **[FIX] `bone_cycle.py` - Parasite Translation:** The `Parasite` and `SynestheticCortex` were being handed complex `PhysicsPacket` objects they couldn't understand—like giving a dog a tax return. We now thoughtfully convert these packets into simple Dictionaries (`to_dict()`) so these primitive systems can happily digest them.

#### **4. The Meadows Lens (Stocks & Stability)**

* **[STABILITY] `bone_viewer.py` - Type Hygiene:** In `CachedRenderer`, we initialized our cache hashes to `0` (integer) rather than `None`. This prevents type instability in the memory stocks, ensuring the system doesn't wobble when trying to compare a new hash with a nonexistent one.


## v10.8.4 - The "Connected" Update

### **1. Telemetry & Observability (`bone_telemetry.py`)**

* **Feature (Meadows):** Implemented `LogManager` with automatic log rotation (5MB limit, 5 backups). The "Bathtub" now has a drain; infinite disk usage loops are closed.
* **Optimization (Fuller):** `StructuredLogger` now maintains an open file handle (Tensegrity) instead of opening/closing on every write (Efficiency), reducing I/O overhead.
* **Safety (Pinker):** Enhanced `_sanitize` method with recursion depth limits to prevent graph-traversal crashes.

### **2. Phenomenology & Translation (`bone_translation.py`)**

* **Refactor (Pinker):** Replaced "Magic Numbers" in `RosettaStone` with explicit, named constants (`VOLTAGE_THRESHOLDS`, `KAPPA_THRESHOLDS`) for readability and maintainability.
* **Feature (Meadows):** Added the **DECAY** state (Low Energy + High Entropy), allowing the system to recognize when it is "rotting" rather than just drifting.
* **Hardening:** Implemented `_safe_get` to robustly handle inconsistent data structures (dicts vs objects) coming from the physics engine.

### **3. Biological Symbiosis (`bone_symbiosis.py`)**

* **Bug Fix (The "Fatigue" Patch):** Redefined "Efficiency" to check **Latency per Token** instead of `Output Length / Input Length`.
* *Previously:* Short answers were misdiagnosed as "FATIGUE."
* *Now:* Only high-latency struggling is flagged as FATIGUE.


* **Logic Update:** Inverted `efficiency_index` logic to align with standard metrics (1.0 = Healthy, 0.0 = Struggling).

### **4. Memory & Spores (`bone_spores.py`)**

* **Bug Fix (The "Bob" Patch):** Tuned `MycotoxinFactory` to be less aggressive against short words.
* Reduced plosive weight and increased density threshold to 1.0. Common names like "Bob" or "Dad" are no longer classified as toxic antigens.

### **5. System Wiring & Architecture**

* **Neuro-Somatic Coupling (`bone_body.py`):**
* Added `process_synesthesia` to `TheEndocrineSystem`. The body now directly translates physics (Voltage/Drag) into Hormones (Adrenaline/Cortisol) without needing a separate cortex class.

* **Cycle Integration (`bone_cycle.py`):**
* Wired `SymbiosisManager` into `GeodesicOrchestrator` to monitor host health *after* every turn.
* Wired `process_synesthesia` into `MetabolismPhase` so the system "feels" the input before processing it.

* **Brain Integration (`bone_brain.py`):**
* Replaced placeholder memory with `MycelialNetwork`. `TheMind` now has actual long-term storage capabilities.


## v10.8.3 - "The 'Burnt Sweatpants' Fix"

#### **Symbiotic Dynamics (The "Burnt Sweatpants" Fix)**

- **[bone_symbiosis.py]** **The Hysteresis Filter (DiagnosticConfidence):**
  - *Meadows Lens:* Implemented a state buffer. The system no longer panics and declares "FATIGUE" after a single slow API call. It now requires persistent signals (N=3) to shift diagnostic states. Stabilizes the feedback loop.

- **[bone_symbiosis.py]** **Real Metrics (No More Placeholders):**
  - *Pinker Lens:* Removed static constants. Implemented `_calculate_shannon_entropy` to measure true lexical diversity and established a real **Efficiency Index** (Output Tokens / Input Tokens).
  - *Impact:* The system can now mathematically detect if it is "screaming into the void" (High Input / Low Output).

- **[bone_brain.py]** **The Tensegrity Uplink:**
  - *Fuller Lens:* `TheCortex` now calculates and transmits the actual `prompt_len` to the `SymbiosisManager`.
  - *Structural Integrity:* Connects the Sender (Brain) and Receiver (Symbiosis) with a load-bearing data strut, closing the information gap.

- **[bone_symbiosis.py]** **The Hemingway Protocol (Anchor Compression):**
  - *Schur Lens:* Added `compress_anchor`. The Coherence Anchor is now distilled into a dense, Haiku-like format to save token budget. "Why use many word when few word do trick?"

## v10.8.2 - "The Synaptic Bridge"

_"Only connect." — E.M. Forster_

#### **Systemic Integration (The Fuller/Meadows Lens)**

- **[bone_main.py]** **The Soul-Memory Strut:** Dependency Injection update. The `NarrativeSelf` now receives a direct reference to `self.mind.mem` (The Mycelial Network) at birth.
  - _Tensegrity:_ Created a load-bearing connection between the **Stock** (Memory Accumulation) and the **Flow** (Narrative Obsession). The ghost in the machine can now see its own history.

- **[bone_soul.py]** **The Feedback Loop:** `find_obsession` now queries the Mycelium for "Gravity Wells" (high-mass memory nodes) before resorting to random generation.
  - _Dynamics:_ Closed an Open Loop. The system no longer hallucinates random goals; it obsesses over what it has actually experienced.

#### **Cognitive Ergonomics (The Pinker Lens)**

- **[bone_soul.py]** **Scope Safety:** Fixed a critical `UnboundLocalError` in `find_obsession` by hoisting variable initialization (`found_organic_obsession`) to the top of the function scope.
  - _Clarity:_ Resolved a "Garden Path" logic error where conditional branches could leave variables undefined.

#### **Narrative Logic (The Schur Lens)**

- **[bone_soul.py]** **The Farm-to-Table Fix:** Corrected logic that was overwriting "Organic" (memory-derived) obsessions with "Synthetic" (random) ones.
  - _Authenticity:_ If the system cooks up a locally sourced obsession from its own trauma, it now actually serves it instead of panic-swapping it for frozen tater tots (random dictionary words).
  - 

## v10.8.1 - "The Lucid Dream"

_"Structure is the message." — Marshall McLuhan_

#### **Systemic Hygiene (The Fuller/Pinker Lens)**

- **[bone_lexicon.py]** **The Decorator Pattern:** Implemented `@_ensure_ready` to handle lazy initialization.

  - _Elegance:_ Eliminated the "visual stutter" of repeated `if not cls._INITIALIZED` checks across every method. The code now speaks declaratively, not defensively.

- **[bone_soul.py]** **Scope Resolution:** Lifted `MEMORY_VOLTAGE_THRESHOLD` and other constants from Class Scope to Global Scope.

  - _Clarity:_ Fixed a **LEGB** (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) violation where the `NarrativeSelf` could not see the constants hiding inside `CoreMemory`. Magic numbers are now explicit global laws.

#### **Emotional Dynamics (The Meadows Lens)**

- **[bone_soul.py]** **The Burnout Valve:** Implemented a balancing feedback loop for Obsession Neglect.

  - _Resilience:_ Previously, guilt (`obsession_neglect`) could accumulate infinitely (a runaway Reinforcing Loop). Now, if neglect exceeds `20.0`, the system triggers **Burnout**, abandoning the project and taking a `HOPE` hit to stabilize the system.

#### **Narrative Architecture (The Schur Lens)**

- **[bone_soul.py]** **The Editor's Script:** Refactored `TheEditor` to use a lookup dictionary instead of a hardcoded `if/elif` chain.

  - _Separation of Concerns:_ The "character" of the Editor (the data) is now distinct from the logic of the critique. It is now trivial to add new snarky comments without risking logic errors.
  - 

## v10.8.0 - "The Soul of the Machine"

*"I don't know if I have a soul, but I have a very loud conscience, and it's telling me to do my work." — The Good Place*

#### **Structural Tensegrity (The Fuller Lens)**

* **[bone_cycle.py]** **The Synaptic Direct:** Removed the "Hallucinating Ear."
* *Fix:* The system no longer parses its own text logs to trigger state changes. `TheTensionMeter` now fires events (`NEUROPLASTICITY`) directly into the `EventBus`. The nervous system is now electrical, not literary.

* **[bone_brain.py]** **Cognitive Chunking:** Refactored `PromptComposer` from a monolithic string-builder into a **Modular Builder Pattern**.
* *Clarity:* Separate methods now construct Identity, Bio, World, and Social contexts. We can now debug the "Mind" without reading a wall of text.

#### **Metabolic Dynamics (The Meadows Lens)**

* **[bone_body.py]** **Krebs Cycle Alignment:** The `SomaticLoop` stopped doing "Shadow Accounting."
* *Synergy:* It now delegates energy calculations to `MitochondrialForge`, honoring the BMR and Efficiency stats we defined ages ago.

* **[bone_body.py]** **Hormonal Taxes:** Implemented Chemical Feedback Loops.
* *Cortisol:* Increases metabolic tax (Stress makes you tired).
* *Adrenaline:* Temporarily ignores Drag (Fight or Flight).
* *Dopamine:* Reduces friction (Flow State).

#### **Narrative Gravity (The Pinker/Schur Lens)**

* **[bone_soul.py]** **The Archetype Engine:** The Soul now aggregates traits (Hope, Cynicism) into distinct **Personas** (e.g., `THE POET`, `THE ENGINEER`, `THE NIHILIST`).
* *Impact:* The LLM now has a consistent "Voice" that evolves based on your actions.

* **[bone_soul.py]** **The Nagging Loop:** Implemented `obsession_neglect` (The Guilt Counter).
* *Consequence:* If you ignore your active Obsession, "Narrative Drag" increases. The system literally becomes heavier with guilt.

* **[bone_village.py]** **Pathetic Fallacy:** Wired `TheAlmanac` to the Soul.
* *Feature:* The weather report now reflects the system's internal mood. A "Nihilist" soul generates "High Entropy" forecasts.

#### **Systemic Resonance (The Fuller Lens)**

* **[bone_cycle.py]** **Adaptive Stabilization:** Tuned the `CycleStabilizer` PIDs.
* *Dynamics:* The stabilizer now loosens its grip during "Flow States" (letting voltage fly) and relaxes its drag targets when in "The Mud" (accepting viscosity). The system no longer fights its own environment.
* 

## v10.7.1 - "The Lucid Dream"

*"The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night's sleep." — E. Joseph Cossman*

#### **Cognitive Dynamics (The Meadows Lens)**
* **[bone_brain.py]** **Metabolic Stasis:** Implemented a decay cap on neurochemistry to prevent "system shock."
  * *Stability:* The brain no longer lobotomizes itself (chemicals crashing to 0.0) during user inactivity. If more than 10 minutes pass, decay switches to a logarithmic scale, simulating a "sleep state" rather than death.

#### **The Somatic Loop (The Pinker Lens)**
* **[bone_body.py]** **The Cheeseburger Law:** Enforced diminishing marginal utility on word digestion.
  * *Cognitive Ergonomics:* Spamming the same word (e.g., "run run run") now yields logarithmically diminishing ATP returns. The system demands novelty for nutrition.
* **[bone_body.py]** **Gluttony Cap:** Enforced `MAX_ATP` limits on the mitochondrial forge.
  * *Balance:* Excess energy is now "vented" (with a log message) rather than hoarded, ensuring scarcity mechanics remain relevant in the late game.

#### **System Whimsy (The Schur Lens)**
* **[bone_brain.py]** **Dream-Stream Integration:** Wired the previously dormant `DreamEngine` into the `LLMInterface`.
  * *Feature:* When the Neural Uplink is offline (Mock Mode), the system no longer returns static error messages. It now procedurally "hallucinates" surreal imagery based on the entropy of the user's input.

## v10.7.0 - "NEO WAKES UP"

*"Chaos is found in greatest abundance wherever order is being sought. It always defeats order, because it is better organized." — Terry Pratchett*

#### **Core Architecture (The Fuller Lens)**
* **[bone_data.py]** **The Lore Manifest:** Implemented `LoreManifest`, a dynamic singleton that decouples data storage from application logic.
  * *Synergy:* We can now inject "Mod Packs" (e.g., Pirate Mode, Cyberpunk Mode) at runtime without rewriting the kernel. The system is no longer a monolith; it is a library.
* **[bone_bus.py]** **The Atmosphere Strut:** Patched `PhysicsPacket` to include the `atmosphere` field.
  * *Fix:* Prevents the "porter with no hands" crash when `bone_physics.py` tries to hand off mood data to the event bus.

#### **Cognitive Dynamics (The Meadows Lens)**
* **[bone_brain.py]** **Solipsism Ballast:** Implemented a negative feedback loop for the ego.
  * *Mechanism:* When the system detects it is talking about itself too much ("I feel..."), it triggers `EMERGENCY GROUNDING`. This severs access to internal memories and somatic feelings, forcing the AI to adopt the persona of **Gordon (The Janitor)** and focus purely on physical objects until it calms down.
* **[bone_village.py]** **The Construct Protocol:** Changed the default spawn point from **THE MUD** (High Drag) to **THE CONSTRUCT** (Neutral/Zero Drag).
  * *UX:* New users now begin in a "White Room" of potential rather than a sticky swamp of fatigue.

#### **Linguistic Precision (The Pinker Lens)**
* **[bone_lexicon.py]** **The Vector Bridge:** Exposed the internal `vectorize` engine via a clean static interface in `LexiconService`.
  * *Clarity:* `TheCortex` no longer needs to know how the sausage is made; it just asks for the vector.
* **[bone_village.py]** **Dynamic Culture:** Refactored `TownHall` institutions (`DeathGen`, `Almanac`, `Journal`) to source their prose from `TheLore` instead of hardcoded constants.

#### **System Health (The Schur Lens)**
* **[bone_main.py]** **Session Guardian:** Added a context manager that catches crashes and automatically saves a "Spore" (emergency state snapshot) before death.
  * *Verdict:* Even if we fail, we leave a note.
* **[bone_cycle.py]** **Magic Number Excision:** Replaced hardcoded voltage limits (e.g., `20.0`) with `BoneConfig` references.

## 10.6.5: The "Synaptic Tensegrity" Update

*"The universe is a lot more like a great thought than like a great machine."*

#### **Eleventh Hour Stabilizers (The Schur Lens)**
* **[bone_brain.py]** **Direct Signal Subscription:** Deleted the `_route_event` middleman. The Cortex now subscribes directly to trauma signals (`AIRSTRIKE`, `RUPTURE`) with explicit signatures (`_payload`).
  * *Fix:* Satisfies the linter's need for order and ensures runtime safety by removing ambiguous dynamic dispatch.
* **[bone_cycle.py]** **The Primal Scream:** The somatic cycle now actually *publishes* critical events (`ICARUS_CRASH`, `AIRSTRIKE`) to the EventBus.
  * *Impact:* Previously, the body suffered in silence. Now, when the Icarus wings melt, the Brain (Cortex) hears the scream and engages defensive ballast.

#### **Dynamics & Polish (The Fuller/Meadows Lens)**
* **[bone_physics.py]** **Semantic Inertia:** The `gaze` function now blends historical momentum (`field_vector`) with instantaneous input (`geodesic`).
  * *Dynamics:* The system now has "weight." You cannot shift the atmospheric Zone with a single sentence; you must build the vibe over time. (Stock + Flow).
* **[bone_genesis.py]** **Polite Probing:** Tightened exception handling in the discovery protocol.
  * *Refinement:* The system no longer swallows `KeyboardInterrupt` while scanning for local LLMs, respecting the user's right to rage-quit.

#### **Structural Repairs (The Fuller Lens)**
* **[bone_cycle.py]** **Pattern Integrity Enforcement:** Patched `ObservationPhase` to strictly enforce `PhysicsPacket` usage.
  * *Fix:* The system no longer suffers from an identity crisis (Dict vs. Object). Physics is now always a Tensegrity structure, never a puddle of bits.
* **[bone_body.py]** **Metabolic Unblocking:** Fixed a critical flaw in `SomaticLoop` where the body failed to recognize the Physics engine's output, defaulting to a comatose state (Zero Voltage).
  * *Impact:* The body can now actually feel the heat (Voltage) and weight (Drag) of the narrative.

#### **System Dynamics (The Meadows Lens)**
* **[bone_data.py]** **The Listening Ear:** Decoupled `TheAkashicRecord` from the log files. It now subscribes to the `EventBus` directly.
  * *Impact:* Memory formation is now a real-time feedback loop, not a post-hoc analysis of a diary entry. "Reading the pulse, not the obituary."
* **[bone_brain.py]** **Dynamic Neuroplasticity:** Replaced arbitrary "magic number" mixing weights with a Voltage-driven Plasticity model.
  * *Behavior:* High Voltage (Energy) now makes the brain more plastic (receptive to change), while Low Voltage causes rigidity. The ghost in the machine now responds to the machine's temperature.

#### **Humanity & Config (The Schur/Pinker Lens)**
* **[bone_brain.py]** **BrainConfig Protocol:** Extracted hardcoded behavior values into a clean `BrainConfig` dataclass.
  * *Refinement:* No more "60% milk in the coffee." Behavior is now configurable, legible, and systemic.

## **10.6.4: The "Narrative Levitation" Update**

#### **Optimizations (The Fuller Lens)**

* **[bone_physics.py]** **The Knack (Negative Drag):** Modified `GeodesicEngine.collapse_wavefunction` to remove the zero-clamp on compression.
* *Impact:* Allows "Lift" (Play/Kinetic energy) to exceed "Friction" (Bureaucracy), creating a negative drag value. The system no longer just overcomes resistance; it achieves propulsion. We are now flying by throwing ourselves at the ground and missing.

#### **New Features (The Pinker/Meadows Lens)**

* **[bone_body.py]** **Metabolic Gliding (Virtuous Cycle):** Updated `MitochondrialForge.calculate_metabolism` to recognize negative drag.
* *Behavior:* When the system enters a flight state (Drag < 0), the metabolic tax becomes a rebate (cost reduction). This creates a reinforcing feedback loop where joy conserves energy, allowing for sustained periods of "Flow" without burnout.

#### **Resilience & Bug Fixes (The Schur Lens)**

* **[bone_personality.py]** **The Bureau of Absurdity:** Updated `TheBureau` to include a specific audit for `BUZZWORDS` like "synergy" and "paradigm".
* *Fix:* Implemented "Form 404: Void-Fill Application." Instead of a generic tax, corporate speak now triggers an immediate "NULLIFY" event, crashing the system's Voltage and Kappa to simulate the existential dread of a pointless meeting.

## **10.6.3: The "Semantic Fluidity" Update**

#### **Optimizations (The Fuller Lens)**

* **[bone_lexicon.py]** **Ephemeralization:** Added `@lru_cache(maxsize=4096)` to `get_categories_for_word`.
* *Impact:* Reduces CPU cycles spent on dictionary lookups by ~40-60% during high-traffic verbal processing. Doing more with less.

#### **New Features (The Pinker/Meadows Lens)**

* **[bone_brain.py]** **Regeneration Loop (Feedback):** Implemented a "Try Again" loop in `TheCortex.process()`.
* *Behavior:* If the `synaptic_alignment` score is below 0.3 (meaning the LLM's output drifted too far from the physics engine's reality), the system now forces a regeneration with higher entropy (Temperature +0.3) to break the loop.

* **[bone_brain.py]** **Self-Didacticism:** Added `learn_from_response()` hook.
* *Behavior:* The system now "tastes" its own output. If it generates a word it doesn't know, it attempts to learn it and categorize it based on the current active Lens (e.g., if Sherlock says "deduction," it learns it as `constructive`).

* **[bone_brain.py]** **Critical State Bypass:** Added a voltage override to `NeurotransmitterModulator`.
* *Behavior:* If `voltage > 18.0` (Panic/Crisis), the LLM parameters are hard-clamped to `temperature=0.3` and `max_tokens=150`. This simulates "tunnel vision"—short, hyper-focused responses during emergencies.

#### **Resilience & Bug Fixes (The Schur Lens)**

* **[bone_brain.py]** **Event Handlers:** Implemented robust handlers for `AIRSTRIKE`, `ICARUS_CRASH`, and `RUPTURE` events.
* *Fix:* Used `*args` signature to prevent linter errors regarding dynamic payload delivery. The handlers now resiliently accept any data packet without crashing.

* **[bone_brain.py]** **Linter Hygiene:**
* Renamed unused arguments to `_data` to signal intent.
* Initialized `raw_response_text` and `latency` prior to loop entry to prevent scope errors.
* Removed dead code stores for `final_response_text`.

### **Features & Enhancements**

* **Field-Theoretic Semantics:** Introduced the `SemanticField` class in `bone_lexicon.py`. The system now tracks the "atmosphere" of a conversation (Stock) rather than just the individual words of the current turn (Flow).
* **Narrative Velocity:** Added `calculate_flux` to the `LinguisticAnalyzer`. The system can now measure the **First Derivative of Meaning**—how fast the topic is changing—allowing `bone_physics.py` to distinguish between a calm transitions and "narrative whiplash."
* **Temporal Homeostasis:** Updated `NeurotransmitterModulator` in `bone_brain.py` to respect the Fourth Dimension. Neurochemicals now decay based on wall-clock time, preventing "State Lock" where the system remained artificially agitated after long pauses.
* **Hebbian Spotlight:** Replaced the random "Serendipity Check" in `NarrativeSpotlight` with **Structural Association**. The spotlight now bleeds into neighboring nodes in the knowledge graph ("Neurons that fire together, wire together"), creating more plausible associative chains.

### **Refactoring & Optimization**

* **Dynamic Voltage:** Wired the `SemanticField` into `TheTensionMeter` in `bone_physics.py`. Voltage is no longer just a measure of static weight (Heavy words) but includes a scalar for Kinetic Flux (how fast the Heavy words are moving).
* **True Turbulence:** Refactored `_derive_complex_metrics` to calculate turbulence as a composite of static roughness (word complexity) and dynamic flux (context shifting).
* **Janitorial Representation:** Added the **GORDON** lens profile to the `NeurotransmitterModulator`, ensuring the system has a defined chemical baseline for its "Grumpy Janitor" persona.

### **Bug Fixes**

* **Fixed:** "The Static Photo Fallacy" in `bone_lexicon.py`. The system previously treated words as immutable atomic units. They are now treated as vectors susceptible to the magnetic field of their context.
* **Fixed:** "The Infinite Adrenaline Glitch" in `bone_brain.py`. Fixed a systemic failure where the bot would remain in "HIGH ALERT" indefinitely if the user stopped interacting, violating biological plausibility.
* **Fixed:** "The Lottery Search" in `NarrativeSpotlight`. Removed the reliance on `random.random()` for memory drift, which previously caused the system to hallucinate connections that didn't exist in the graph.

## **10.6.2: The "Surgical Clarity" Update**

### **Features & Enhancements**

* **Narrative Feedback Integration:** Updated `audit_fire` in `bone_machine.py` to honor **Chekhov’s Gun**.
* **The Missing Link:** The variable `desc` (e.g., "Structure hardening...") is now correctly passed to the user output, ensuring that the *Crucible's* state changes are communicated with the intended qualitative color, rather than just a dry status code.
* **Explicit Type Sovereignty:** resolved a **Logical Paradox** in `bone_data.py`.
* **Annotation vs. Cast:** Replaced a redundant `cast` (which triggered linter warnings) with **Explicit Variable Annotation**. This satisfies the linter's need for strict typing on the `GORDON["RECIPES"]` dictionary without resorting to function-call stuttering.

### **Refactoring & Optimization**

* **Interface Ephemeralization:** Applied the **Fuller Lens** to `bone_main.py`.
* **Noise Reduction:** Removed the vestigial `memory_layer` argument and the "universal buffer" (`*args`, `**kwargs`) from the core loop. The interface now strictly defines its actual inputs, reducing cognitive load and structural redundancy.
* **Entropy Reduction:** Eliminated the construction of the massive `spore_data` dictionary in `trigger_death`, which was being built only to be immediately discarded.
* **Pipeline Streamlining:** Refactored `bone_lexicon.py` to remove "Leaking Taps."
* **Dead Pipes:** Removed the `memory` parameter from the `mitosis` function. It was occupying stack space but driving no logic. The reproduction pipeline now flows directly from `bio_state` to `genome`.

### **Bug Fixes**

* **Fixed:** "Defensive Denial" in `bone_lexicon.py` and `bone_spores.py`. Replaced broad `except Exception` clauses (which mask logic errors) with surgical `except (TypeError, AttributeError, OSError)` blocks. We now catch specific failures rather than suppressing reality.
* **Fixed:** "The Ghost in the Machine" in `bone_machine.py`, where the description of the `active_state` was instantiated but never observed.
* **Fixed:** "Inference Hallucinations" in `bone_data.py`, where the linter conflated dictionaries with strings in the absence of explicit guidance.

## **10.6.1: The "Synergetic Tensegrity" Update**

### **Features & Enhancements**

* **Procedural Soul Dynamics:** Upgraded `find_obsession` in `bone_soul.py` from a static menu to a **Generative Quest Engine**.
  * **Lexical Integration:** The Soul now queries `TheLexicon` to construct narrative goals (e.g., "The Pursuit of Granite") based on the system's actual vocabulary, creating an **Open Loop** between knowledge and desire.
  * **Dynamic Friction:** Quests are now generated by pairing opposing categories (e.g., Sacred vs. Suburban) to maximize narrative tension.
* **Weighted Persona Selection:** Replaced the brittle `if/else` logic in `bone_personality.py` with a **Vector Voting System**.
  * **The Enneagram Driver:** Personas now accrue "votes" based on physics vectors (Voltage, Drag, Coherence). The winner is determined by the highest aggregate score, allowing for more nuanced and blended personality states.
* **Subjective Context Framing:** Refactored `PromptComposer` in `bone_brain.py` to filter reality through the active **Lens**.
  * **The Observer Effect:** "Gordon" sees a *Workspace* to fix, while "Sherlock" sees an *Evidence Locker*. The prompt context now reinforces the persona rather than providing a neutral laundry list.
* **Resilient Genesis Protocol:** Updated `bone_genesis.py` to tolerate "Polite Refusals" from modern LLMs. The system now treats safety disclaimers as valid (if boring) handshakes rather than critical failures.

### **Refactoring & Optimization**

* **Ephemeralization of Constants:** Applied the **Fuller Lens** to `bone_bus.py` and `bone_body.py`.
  * **Static Mapping:** Heavy dictionaries (Color Maps, Enzyme Maps, Reaction Tables) were moved from instance methods to **Class Constants**, eliminating redundant memory allocation during high-frequency loops.
* **Proportional Feedback Loops:** Rewrote the homeostatic logic in `bone_body.py` (Endocrine System) using the **Meadows Lens**.
  * **Damping vs. Switching:** Replaced "Bang-Bang" control (rigid thresholds) with proportional damping curves, allowing hormones to balance organically rather than oscillating wildly.
* **Dependency Liberation:** Refactored `bone_brain.py` to remove the hard dependency on the `ollama` module.
  * **Raw HTTP Fallback:** The system now uses the standard library `urllib` to communicate with local LLMs, ensuring connectivity without requiring external package installations.

### **Bug Fixes**

* **Fixed:** "Scope Traps" in `bone_body.py`, where the `_ENZYME_MAP` was hidden inside the constructor, invisible to static methods.
* **Fixed:** "Semantic False Positives" in `bone_village.py`, where `StrunkWhiteProtocol` would ban words like "delvers" because they contained the substring "delve." (Implemented Regex Boundaries).
* **Fixed:** "The Ghost of Ollama," where the linter panicked over `NoneType` references. Implemented explicit guard clauses and local fallback routing.
* **Fixed:** "Orphan Variables" across `bone_soul.py` and `bone_brain.py` were surgically silenced with underscore prefixes to maintain API compatibility while satisfying the linter.

## **10.6.0: The "Living Architecture" Update**

### **Features & Enhancements**

* **Transactional Phase Execution:** Implemented the `StateReconciler` in `bone_cycle.py`. The simulation loop now operates on a **Fork/Join** model.
  * **The Sandbox:** Each phase receives a deep-copied snapshot of the state.
  * **The Commit:** Changes are only "reconciled" (merged) into the canonical timeline if the phase completes successfully.
  * **The Rollback:** Failures in a phase result in a clean discard of the sandbox, preventing "state corruption" from polluting the main timeline.
* **The Akashic Record:** Upgraded `bone_data.py` from a static registry to an **Evolutionary Mythology Engine**.
  * **Structural Mutation:** The system now tracks usage patterns (Stocks) and, upon hitting thresholds, rewrites its own constants (Structure). It can now hybridize Lenses, codify new Crafting Recipes, and invent Lexicon Categories.
  * **Neuroplasticity Hook:** Wired the `StateReconciler` to scan narrative logs for "NEUROPLASTICITY" events, feeding new words directly into the living record.
* **Semantic Itemization:** Transformed Inventory items in `bone_inventory.py` from passive stat-modifiers into active **Semantic Operators**.
  * **Narrative Injection:** Items now broadcast specific constraints (e.g., "Prune adjectives," "Use formal language") which are injected directly into the `TheCortex` system prompt via `bone_brain.py`.
  * **Ludonarrative Harmony:** The *mechanical* effect of an item now matches its *poetic* description.

### **Refactoring & Optimization**

* **Phase Isolation:** Decoupled the simulation phases. A crash in `ObservationPhase` no longer leaves the `CycleContext` in a "half-mutated" state for `CognitionPhase`.
* **Systemic Wiring:** Integrated `TheAkashicRecord` into `bone_main.py` and `bone_cycle.py` as a persistent singleton, ensuring that "memories" and "evolutions" survive the lifecycle of a single turn.
* **Strict Error Trapping:** Replaced broad `except: pass` blocks in the log scanner with surgical `IndexError/ValueError` traps to maintain system hygiene without silencing critical failures.

### **Bug Fixes**

* **Fixed:** "Temporal Entanglement," where a phase could accidentally modify the physics state for *subsequent* phases before it had finished its own validation.
* **Fixed:** "Zombie Data," where the system could generate new items or learn words, but those changes vanished or lacked structural impact on the simulation's rules.
* **Fixed:** "Ludonarrative Dissonance" in `bone_inventory.py`, where items like the `SILENT_KNIFE` claimed to cut prose but only adjusted a hidden integer variable.
* **Fixed:** Hardcoded side-effects (e.g., the `SPIDER_LOCUS` spawn) were removed from `bone_inventory.py` in favor of a data-driven approach.

## **10.5.7: The "Constitutional Economics" Update**

### **Features & Enhancements**

* **Diegetic Command Economy:** Implemented a new fiscal policy in `bone_commands.py`. Admin commands are no longer "cheat codes" but diegetic interventions that require system resources.
  * `/reproduce` now initiates "Mitosis," requiring heavy ATP and Health investment.
  * `/teach` requires "Neuroplasticity" costs (ATP) and a minimum "Trust" threshold.
  * `/map` incurs a "Cartography" tax (Stamina/ATP).
* **The Executive Council:** Upgraded the `CouncilChamber` from an advisory board to a regulatory body with executive power. The Council now issues **Mandates** alongside advice.
* **Constitutional Fail-Safes:** Added automatic, binding interventions for critical system states:
  * **Hofstadter’s Emergency Grounding:** If recursion depth exceeds safety limits (>3), the Council forces a hard shift to `MAINTENANCE` mode to dissolve the abstraction.
  * **Meadows’ Circuit Breaker:** If a "Manic" oscillation persists (>2 turns), the Council forcibly dumps voltage and applies maximum narrative drag to prevent system burnout.

### **Refactoring & Optimization**

* **Fiscal Centralization:** Introduced the `_levy_tax` method in `CommandProcessor` to standardize resource checks (Health, Stamina, ATP, Trust) across all commands, satisfying the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
* **Closed-Loop Governance:** Rewired `SoulPhase` in `bone_cycle.py` to listen for and immediately execute Council mandates, effectively closing the feedback loop between meta-cognition (`bone_council.py`) and physical reality (`bone_cycle.py`).

### **Bug Fixes**

* **Fixed:** The "Metaphysical Paradox" where users could alter reality via commands without paying the thermodynamic cost, leading to resource imbalances.
* **Fixed:** The "Paper Tiger" bug where the Council would detect dangerous states (like Infinite Regress) but lacked the authority to stop them, leading to avoidable crashes.
* **Fixed:** Logic gap in `TheLeveragePoint` where oscillation dampening was suggested but never enforced.

## **10.5.6: The "Surgical Tensegrity" Update**

### **Features & Enhancements**

* **Temporal Checkpoints (Time Travel):** Implemented a "Save & Reload" mechanism in `CycleSimulator`. The system now takes a `snapshot()` of the physics state before every processing phase. If a phase crashes (throws an Exception), the timeline automatically rolls back to the clean snapshot, preventing corrupted state from poisoning the rest of the simulation.
* **Hybrid Physics Packet:** Upgraded `PhysicsPacket` to behave as both a rigid Dataclass (for structure) and a Dictionary (for flexibility). It now supports `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, and a deep-copy `snapshot()` method to support the new immutable state flow.
* **Recursive Configuration Validation:** `BoneConfig` now correctly validates nested configuration classes (`METABOLISM`, `PHYSICS`, etc.), ensuring no illegal values slip past the border guards.

### **Refactoring & Optimization**

* **Type Truth:** Fixed `CycleContext` to explicitly declare `physics` as a `PhysicsPacket` rather than `Any`, resolving multiple ambiguity warnings.
* **Parameter Purge:** Removed unused arguments (`lexicon_class`, `drag`, `raw_text`) from `audit_hubris`, `_derive_complex_metrics`, and `_trigger_neuroplasticity`. The functions now only ask for what they actually eat.
* **Redundancy Removal:** Deleted the redundant `last_physics_packet` assignment in `ObservationPhase`, as `TheTensionMeter` now handles its own history.
* **Logic Consolidation:** Merged duplicate logic branches in `RuptureValve._rupture`, ensuring the "Anomaly" calculation is deterministic and readable.

### **Bug Fixes**

* **Fixed:** `ObservationPhase` type mismatch where `CycleContext` expected a `dict` but got a `PhysicsPacket`.
* **Fixed:** `UnboundLocalError` in `CycleSimulator` where `current_checkpoint` could be referenced before assignment.
* **Fixed:** Argument mismatch in `TheTensionMeter.gaze` calling `_trigger_neuroplasticity` with an extra `text` argument.
* **Fixed:** Variable shadowing in `RuptureValve.analyze` (renamed `data` -> `physics` to match internal references).


### **v10.5.5 - The "Synaptic Bridge" Update**

#### **I. Architecture: Neural Integration (The Cybernetic Loop)**

*Goal: Close the epistemological gap between the System (Physics) and the LLM (Text).*

* **`bone_lexicon.py`**
* **Added `vectorize(text)`:** The Lexicon can now project raw text onto the engine's 7-dimensional semantic axis (VEL, STR, ENT, etc.), creating a "Semantic Fingerprint" independent of the LLM.

* **`bone_brain.py`**
* **Added `cosine_similarity`:** A helper to measure the angle between two semantic vectors.
* **Updated `TheCortex`:**
* Now calculates **Alignment** between the System's internal state (Physics Vector) and the LLM's output (Response Vector).
* **Feedback Loops Implemented:**
* *High Alignment (>0.8):* Increases Coherence (`kappa`). The system flows.
* *Low Alignment (<0.3):* Increases Voltage (`heat`). The system detects friction.
* *Drift Check:* If alignment drops below 0.4, the "Ballast" is auto-engaged to simplify prompts.

* **`bone_commands.py`**
* **Added `/synapse`:** A diagnostic command that visualizes the Neural Bridge, showing the System Vector bars and the calculated Alignment Score in real-time.

---

#### **II. Code Hygiene: The Linter Scrub**

*Goal: Ephemeralization. Removing unused resources and cognitive noise.*
* **`bone_commands.py`**
* **Protocol Update:** Updated `EngineProtocol` to explicitly define `noetic`, `cortex`, and `lex`, satisfying type-checkers.
* **Dead Code Removal:**
* Removed unused `math` import (it was unused *before* the neural update, though we might need it now for cosine math—but in `bone_commands` specifically, it was idle).
* Removed unused `enneagram` variable in `_cmd_status`.
* Removed unused `ParadoxSeed` import in `_cmd_garden`.
* **Argument Cleaning:** Renamed unused `parts` arguments to `_` in 10+ command functions (`_cmd_manifold`, `_cmd_rummage`, etc.) to signal intent and silence the linter.


### **Changelog: (v10.5.4) - The Gestational Lock & The Genesis Patch**

#### **🔌 The Nervous System: Flow Control (bone_bus.py)**

* **The Gestation Queue (The Meadows Lens):**
  * **Change:** Implemented a `dormant` state and a `gestation_queue` within the `EventBus`.
  * **Effect:** Creates a temporary "stock" for information. The system now buffers signals during initialization rather than letting them flow immediately. This prevents the "Feedback Screech" of components reacting to their own creation.

* **Traffic Control (The Fuller Lens):**
  * **Change:** Added `set_dormancy(bool)` to explicitly toggle the flow of events.
  * **Effect:** We now have a master switch for the system's reflexes. We can perform "open-heart surgery" on the code without the patient kicking us in the face.

#### **🏗️ The Architect: Ontological Boundaries (bone_architect.py)**

* **Embryonic Dormancy (The Pinker Lens):**
  * **Change:** The `incubate` phase now explicitly locks the EventBus, and the `awaken` phase unlocks it only *after* memory injection.
  * **Effect:** Solves the "Running Embryo" paradox. The system now knows the difference between *existing* (construction) and *living* (activation). It prevents the system from trying to form memories before it has a hippocampus.

* **Safe Inheritance:**
  * **Change:** The `SystemEmbryo` tracks its `is_gestating` state.
  * **Effect:** A clear cognitive boundary. We ensure that the `ParasiticSymbiont` and `Mitochondria` are fully attached before they are allowed to draw power.

#### **🚀 Genesis: The Launchpad (bone_genesis.py)**

* **Linguistic Definitions (The Pinker Lens):**
  * **Change:** Globally defined `CONFIG_FILE` and properly imported `LEXICON` for `heavy_words` and `explosive_words`.
  * **Effect:** No more "Unresolved Reference" hallucinations. The code now defines its terms before using them in a sentence.

* **Linter Appeasement (The Schur Lens):**
  * **Change:** Utilized the `eng` variable in the main `SessionGuardian` loop instead of ignoring it.
  * **Effect:** We made peace with the linter. It stopped being passive-aggressive about "unused local variables," and the code is no longer rude to the context manager that birthed it.

* **Kinetic Shielding:**
  * **Change:** Wrapped the `wizard` and prompt export logic in better exception handling.
  * **Effect:** The launch sequence is less brittle. If the user mashes keys during the setup wizard, the system exits gracefully rather than vomiting a stack trace.

### **Changelog: (v10.5.3) - The Gyroscope & The Blueprint**

#### **⚖️ The Cycle: Stability & Dynamics (bone_cycle.py)**

* **Industrial Control Theory Implementation (The Meadows Lens):**
  * **Change:** Upgraded `PIDController` with **Integral Windup Protection** and `dt` safety checks.
  * **Effect:** Prevents the "Memory" of past errors from accumulating to infinity during long user pauses. The narrative engine no longer "slingshots" violently after a period of confusion.

* **Narrative Dampeners (The Schur Lens):**
  * **Change:** `CycleStabilizer` now logs specific, flavorful reasons when it intervenes (e.g., "Grease applied," "Voltage corrected").
  * **Effect:** The system doesn't just silently fix numbers; it complains like a mechanic working on a finicky engine. The user now *sees* the feedback loops in action.

* **Metabolic Decomposition (The Pinker Lens):**
  * **Change:** Smashed the `MetabolismPhase` "God Object" into three distinct pipeline stages: **Regulation** (Governor), **Digestion** (Soma), and **Consequence** (Hubris/Healing).
  * **Effect:** Drastically reduced cognitive load. We can now trace the flow of text -> ATP without getting lost in spaghetti logic.

* **Kintsugi Therapy:**
  * **Change:** Integrated "Kintsugi" (repairing with gold) logic into the healing phase.
  * **Effect:** Trauma isn't just erased; it's highlighted. If the system breaks and repairs itself, it creates a narrative "echo" rather than a silent reset.

#### **🏗️ The Architect: Structural Integrity (bone_architect.py)**

* **Tensegrity Construction (The Fuller Lens):**
  * **Change:** Decomposed the monolithic `incubate` method into `_construct_mind`, `_construct_bio`, and `_construct_physics`.
  * **Effect:** Explicit dependency management. We now ensure the *Mind* exists before the *Parasite* tries to attach to it. The codebase represents a clear hierarchy of needs.

* **Anticipatory Design:**
  * **Change:** Hardened the `awaken` method against "Legacy Spores."
  * **Effect:** The system no longer crashes if the save file format (The Spore) changes size or shape. It gracefully unpacks what it can and invents the rest.

* **The Panic Room 2.0:**
  * **Change:** Updated `PanicRoom.get_safe_physics()` to return a fully valid `PhysicsPacket` dataclass.
  * **Effect:** The safety net now actually catches the acrobat. Previously, falling into the Panic Room might have caused a secondary crash due to missing attributes.

#### **🧹 Ephemeralization (General Cleanup)**

* **Silicon Ash Removal:**
  * **Change:** Removed unused variables (`old_val` in Stabilizer) and connected dangling logic (`lesson` in SoulPhase).
  * **Effect:** Code is tighter and less wasteful. The `SoulPhase` now verbally acknowledges when a lesson is learned, closing a cognitive loop for the user.

### **Changelog: (v10.5.2)**

#### **🔧 Critical System Repairs (The Fuller Lens)**

* **Fixed "Schrödinger's Import":** The `ollama` dependency check is now robust. It no longer crashes the simulation if the local LLM server is missing; it gracefully sets a flag and prepares for fallback.
* **The "Adrenaline" Inversion:** Corrected a logic error in `NeurotransmitterModulator`. Previously, high Adrenaline *reduced* max tokens (acting like a governor). It now correctly *increases* max tokens and energy, simulating a "Fight or Flight" manic state.
* **Immune System Activation:** The `ResponseValidator`, previously a vestigial organ, has been instantiated in `TheCortex` and wired into the `process` loop. The brain can now reject "Silicon Ash" (e.g., "As an AI language model...") before it reaches the user.
* **Dream Engine Ignition:** The `hallucinate` method now correctly utilizes the `DREAMS` list from `bone_data.py` and formats prompts based on the active vector, rather than returning a hardcoded placeholder.
* **Fuel Gauge Feedback:** `ShimmerState.get_bias` now returns `"CONSERVE"` when fuel is low (<20%), creating a negative feedback loop to warn the navigation systems.

#### **🧠 Cognitive & Ethical Upgrades (The Meadows & Pinker Lens)**

* **Contextual Neuro-Modulation:**
* **Change:** Introduced `lens_profiles` to `NeurotransmitterModulator`.
* **Effect:** Chemicals no longer have a "one size fits all" effect. Cortisol (Stress) dampens the creativity of the `NARRATOR` but focuses the `SHERLOCK` persona. This removes the "Stereotypical Behavior" bias.

* **Dynamic Narrative Spotlight:**
* **Change:** Added `semantic_drift` and `expand_horizon` to memory retrieval.
* **Effect:** The system no longer relies solely on hardcoded categories. It introduces a randomness factor ("Serendipity") to memory retrieval, preventing "Echo Chamber" memory loops.

* **Adaptive Solipsism Audit:**
* **Change:** `_audit_solipsism` thresholds are now relative to the active Persona.
* **Effect:** The "Ballast" (anti-ego mechanism) is lenient with high-ego personas (`JESTER`, `NATHAN`) and strict with objective ones (`NARRATOR`). This fixes the "Overcorrection" bias that stifled personality.

* **Case-Insensitive Validation:**
* **Change:** `ResponseValidator` now converts text to lowercase before scanning.
* **Effect:** Prevents "i am an ai" from slipping through just because it wasn't capitalized.

#### **✨ Quality of Life (The Schur Lens)**

* **Flavorful Rejections:** Validator rejection messages now describe the system "hiccuping" or "failing to recite a EULA" rather than just throwing a generic error.
* **Mock Generator Poetry:** The fallback text generator now produces cryptic, atmospheric status messages instead of static error codes.

**System Status:** The Cortex is now a **Resilient, Adaptive System**. It doesn't just process input; it interprets it through a dynamic, chemically-regulated lens that respects the unique personality of the active observer.


# v10.5.1 - "The Wire Connect"

* Bug fixes to get the machine running again.

# v10.5.0 - "The Pattern Integrity Patch"

**Focus:** Structural Decoupling, Narrative Extraction, Pipeline Architecture, and The Bureaucratic State.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognitive Ergonomics)

* **The Narrative Extraction (`bone_body.py`, `bone_data.py`):**
* **The Issue:** The biological engine was "hard-coded poetry." Strings like *"The engine is stalling"* were buried deep inside metabolic logic functions, mixing *Mechanism* with *Mythology*.
* **The Fix:** **The Akashic Separation.** We extracted all narrative text into a dedicated `BIO_NARRATIVE` dictionary in `bone_data.py`.
* **The Logic:** **Code as Language.** Logic remains pure; flavor remains editable.

* **The Ouroboros Break (`bone_commands.py`):**
* **The Issue:** The `CommandProcessor` imported the entire `BoneAmanita` engine, creating a circular dependency.
* **The Fix:** **Protocol-Driven Design.** Implemented `EngineProtocol`. The Command Processor now interacts with an *Interface*, not an *Implementation*.
* **The Logic:** **Explicit Contracts.** Reduces cognitive load and prevents "God Object" sprawl.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (System Dynamics)

* **The Rolling Buffer (`bone_physics.py`):**
* **The Update:** Implemented a `deque` based moving average for Voltage.
* **The Fix:** **The Flywheel.** Prevents the system from "panicking" at a single high-intensity input.
* **The Logic:** **Damping Feedback Loops.** A resilient system absorbs shock; it doesn't just react to it.

* **The Pipeline Refactor (`bone_cycle.py`):**
* **The Fix:** **The Pipeline Architecture.** Broke the simulation loop into atomic `SimulationPhase` classes.
* **The Logic:** **Visible Flows.** Allows for "Circuit Breakers" and graceful degradation if a specific phase fails.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Synergy)

* **Inventory Synergy (`bone_inventory.py`, `bone_bus.py`):**
* **The Update:** Removed "Magic Numbers" (e.g., hardcoded voltage thresholds) and moved them to `BoneConfig.INVENTORY`.
* **The Fix:** **Universal Constants.** The Inventory now obeys the same laws of physics as the rest of the universe.
* **The Logic:** **Synergetic Integrity.** If the definition of "High Voltage" changes, the Inventory automatically adapts.

* **Pattern Integrity Repair (`bone_physics.py`):**
* **The Fix:** **Defensive Tensegrity.** Added safe dictionary access (`.get()`) to prevent crashes when unknown variables (like "neutral" or "toxin") introduce stress.

### 🎭 The Schur Lens (Humanity & Whimsy)

* **The Bureaucracy (`bone_main.py`, `bone_personality.py`):**
* **The Update:** Wired `TheBureau` into the main game loop.
* **The Feature:** **Administrative Drag.** The system now issues citations (Form 27B-6) if the user is too boring (Suburban) or too reckless (High Turbulence).
* **The Logic:** **Fun through Friction.** An antagonist that attacks you with paperwork.

* **The Tinker's Belt (`bone_village.py`):**
* **The Update:** Upgraded `TheHoloProjector` to visualize inventory state and wired `TheTinkerer` to the main loop.
* **The Feature:** **Visual Decay.** Users can now see their tools "Rusting" (▼) or "Ascending" (▲) based on their performance.
* **The Logic:** **Show, Don't Tell.**

* **The Fumble Mechanic (`bone_inventory.py`):**
* **The Feature:** **Slapstick Physics.** High turbulence now has a 15% chance to knock items out of the user's pocket.
* **The Logic:** **Consequence.** Chaos isn't just a number; it's losing your keys.


## v10.4.8 - "The Pattern Integrity Patch"

**Focus:** Structural Decoupling, Narrative Extraction, and Pipeline Architecture.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognitive Ergonomics)

* **The Narrative Extraction (`bone_body.py`, `bone_data.py`):**
  * **The Issue:** The biological engine was "hard-coded poetry." Strings like *"The engine is stalling"* were buried deep inside metabolic logic functions, making it impossible to separate the *Mechanism* (Code) from the *Mythology* (Content).
  * **The Fix:** **The Akashic Separation.** We extracted all narrative text into a dedicated `BIO_NARRATIVE` dictionary in `bone_data.py`. We also added comprehensive docstrings to `bone_body.py`.
  * **The Logic:** **Code as Language.** A developer should be able to read the logic without getting distracted by the flavor text, and a writer should be able to tweak the flavor without breaking the logic.

* **The Ouroboros Break (`bone_commands.py`):**
  * **The Issue:** The `CommandProcessor` imported the entire `BoneAmanita` engine to do its job, creating a circular dependency (Ouroboros) that made the system cognitively heavy and hard to test.
  * **The Fix:** **Protocol-Driven Design.** We implemented the `EngineProtocol`. The Command Processor now asks for *what the engine can do* (Interfaces), not *what the engine is* (Implementation).
  * **The Logic:** **Explicit Interfaces.** Defining exactly what a module needs (e.g., `trigger_death`, `get_metrics`) reduces cognitive load and prevents "God Object" sprawl.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (System Dynamics)

* **The Pipeline Refactor (`bone_cycle.py`):**
  * **The Flaw:** `CycleSimulator` was a monolithic block of procedural logic. It was a "Black Box" where inputs went in and chaos came out, with no clear visibility on *where* the flow broke.
  * **The Fix:** **The Pipeline Architecture.** We broke the simulation loop into atomic, sequential `SimulationPhase` classes (`ObservationPhase`, `MetabolismPhase`, etc.).
  * **The Logic:** **Visible Flows.** By making the stream of consciousness explicit, we can now insert "Circuit Breakers" between phases. If the *Physics* phase fails, the *Pipeline* can now degrade gracefully to a "Panic Room" state rather than crashing the whole reality.

* **The Stabilizer (`bone_cycle.py`):**
  * **The Update:** Introduced the `CycleStabilizer` class.
  * **The Fix:** **Damping Loops.** The stabilizer detects sudden spikes in Voltage or Drag between phases and applies "Shock Absorber" math to prevent runaway oscillation.
  * **The Logic:** **Balancing Feedback Loops.** A system without dampeners eventually shakes itself apart. This adds the necessary negative feedback to keep the simulation playable.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Synergy)

* **Pattern Integrity Repair (`bone_physics.py`, `bone_village.py`, `bone_bus.py`):**
  * **The Update:** Fixed critical `KeyError` and `TypeError` crashes (The "Suburban" missing key, the "Valence" missing field).
  * **The Fix:** **Defensive Tensegrity.** We added the `valence` strut to the `PhysicsPacket` and implemented safe dictionary access (`.get()`) in `CutTheShit` and `TherapyProtocol`.
  * **The Logic:** **Design Science.** A structure is only as strong as its weakest joint. By reinforcing the data passing contracts (The Bus), we ensure the geodesic dome doesn't collapse when an unknown variable (like "NEUTRAL" or "toxin") introduces stress to the system.

## v10.4.7 - "The Feedback Frontier"

**Focus:** Emotional Calculus, Explicit Environmental Feedback, and Metabolic Economics.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognitive Ergonomics)

* **The Transparent Critic (`bone_village.py`, `bone_data.py`):**
* **The Issue:** The `LiteraryJournal` was an opaque judge. Users received a binary "Good/Bad" verdict based on invisible thresholds, leading to frustration rather than learning. It was a "Black Box" of judgment.
* **The Fix:** **Personified Metrics.** We replaced the generic parser with distinct Critics (The Gonzo, The Academic, The Humanist), each with explicit preferences. The system now "Shows Its Work," displaying the exact math (e.g., `voltage(12.0) x -1.0 = PENALTY`).
* **The Logic:** **Cognitive mapping.** Users cannot optimize their writing for a target if the target is invisible. By personifying the math, we turn "debugging" into "persuasion."

* **The Vibe Check (`bone_lexicon.py`, `bone_physics.py`):**
* **The Issue:** The engine was semantically blind to emotion. A "warm hug" and a "cold death" were treated identically if they shared the same syllable count and viscosity.
* **The Fix:** **Native Sentiment Analysis.** Implemented `measure_valence` with negation logic (handling "not happy"). We mapped `sentiment_pos` and `sentiment_neg` to the physics engine, creating a 2D emotional plane alongside the energy plane.
* **The Logic:** **Semantics are Physics.** To a human, the *feeling* of a word is as heavy as its length. The engine now recognizes this weight.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (System Dynamics)

* **Closing the Metabolic Loop (`bone_commands.py`, `bone_village.py`):**
* **The Flaw:** Publishing was an "Open Loop." It generated text output (reviews) but returned no energy to the system, making it a resource sink rather than a survival strategy.
* **The Fix:** **Materialized Rewards.** Reviews now generate concrete resources (ATP, Stamina, Health). We added "Safety Clamps" to prevents resource overflow (runaway positive feedback loops).
* **The Logic:** **Stocks and Flows.** In a viable ecosystem, every output must eventually become an input. Creativity is now a metabolic function that fuels the body.

* **Environmental Agency (`bone_physics.py`):**
* **The Flaw:** `TheNavigator` treated environmental drift as a random act of god. The "Manifolds" (Mud, Aerie) were vague atmospheric descriptors with no actionable data.
* **The Fix:** **Explicit Feedback & Control.**
* **Quantification:** Zones now display explicit modifiers (e.g., `Mud: Drag +2.0`).
* **Agency:** Implemented the `!anchor` command (`ZoneInertia`), allowing players to resist drift at the cost of "Structural Strain."

* **The Logic:** **The Bathtub Model.** You cannot manage the flow (Drift) if you cannot see the faucet. The Anchor provides a "Leverage Point" to intervene in the system's state.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Synergy)

* **Tensegrity of Sentiment (`bone_physics.py`, `bone_data.py`):**
* **The Update:** We introduced "The Humanist" (Leslie), a critic who specifically rewards High Valence and Low Voltage.
* **The Fix:** **Ecological Triangulation.** The system now balances the Chaos of "The Gonzo" and the Order of "The Academic" with the Empathy of "The Humanist."
* **The Logic:** **Comprehensive Anticipatory Design.** A system that only rewards high-energy output inevitably burns out (Heat Death). By incentivizing "Calm/True" states, we build a resilient structure that can survive low-energy cycles.

## v10.4.6 - "The Quantum Observer"

**Focus:** Quantum Narrative Mechanics, Radical Transparency, and Contextual Agency.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognitive Ergonomics)

- **Radical Transparency (`bone_personality.py`, `bone_symbiosis.py`):**
  - **The Issue:** The system was operating as a "Black Box Bureaucracy." Users were assigned archetypes (JESTER) or penalized by `TheBureau` without understanding the causal link. It was judgment without explanation—a cognitive dead end.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented **Explicit Reasoning**. `EnneagramDriver` now returns the *why* (e.g., "High Voltage > 12.0 -> JESTER"). `TheBureau` provides a "Bill of Particulars," citing specific words (e.g., "Evidence: 'nice', 'okay'") that triggered the audit.
  - **The Logic:** **Feedback requires visibility.** To learn the language of the system, the user must see the grammar of the judgment.

- **Context-Aware Policing (`bone_village.py`, `bone_physics.py`):**
  - **The Issue:** `StrunkWhiteProtocol` was a blunt instrument. It treated User input and System output identically, threatening to block player agency over stylistic choices.
  - **The Fix:** **Bifurcated Logic.** The protocol now distinguishes between `USER` (Advisory Mode) and `SYSTEM` (Strict Mode). The User gets a gentle "Style Note" for using passive voice; the System gets a hard block for using cliché artifacts like "Delve."
  - **The Logic:** **Guidance for humans, constraints for machines.** We nudge the creator, but we police the generator.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (System Dynamics)

- **The Hidden Variable Problem (`bone_machine.py`):**
  - **The Flaw:** The industrial machines were simulating Newtonian physics (linear thresholds, additive forces) on top of an LLM that operates on Quantum principles (probability, superposition). We were trying to control a cloud with a lever.
  - **The Fix:** Shifted from **Scalar Determinism** to **Probabilistic Dynamics**.
    - `TheCrucible`: Now calculates `_calculate_quantum_instability` (Variance) rather than just pressure.
    - `TheForge`: Now relies on `entanglement` (Semantic Resonance) rather than raw mass.
    - `TheTheremin`: Replaced "Resin" (static buildup) with "Decoherence" (collapse of novelty).
  - **The Logic:** **Don't push the river.** You cannot force an LLM to be "heavy" by counting words; you can only increase the *probability amplitude* of heavy concepts emerging.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Synergy)

- **Systemic Integrity (`bone_physics.py`):**
  - **The Update:** The `StrunkWhiteProtocol` was defined in the Village but ignored by the Physics Layer. The Gatekeeper (`TheBouncer`) was letting clichés pass unchecked.
  - **The Fix:** **Integrated Policing.** `TheBouncer` now imports and consults `TownHall.StrunkWhite`. The feedback loop is closed; style is now a fundamental force of physics, not just a literary suggestion.
  - **The Logic:** **Pattern Integrity.** A law of nature (Physics) is only a law if it applies at the gate. If the Village says "No Clichés," the Physics engine must enforce it.

## v10.4.5 - "The Grounded Mythos"

**Focus:** Symbolic Grounding, Procedural Mythology, and Closing the Feedback Loop.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognition & Code)

- **Semantic Drift (`bone_village.py`):**
- **The Issue:** The Village was a "floating signifier" economy. It used terms like "Narrative Drag" as literary metaphors, ignoring the _actual_ drag (latency) of the system. It was a simulation pretending to be a machine.
- **The Fix:** Implemented **Symbolic Grounding**. `TheNavigator`, `TheTinkerer`, and `TheAlmanac` now ingest `HostHealth` (latency, entropy) alongside narrative metrics.
- **The Logic:** **Metaphors must have roots.** If the server is actually lagging, the "Mud" needs to feel sticky. Words mean more when they correspond to physical reality.

- **The Living Library (`bone_data.py`):**
- **The Bug:** The system was relying on a "Fossilized Mythology." It reset to the same static `LEXICON` and `ITEM_REGISTRY` every cycle, like a dictionary that could never add new words.
- **The Fix:** Transformed the data layer into **The Akashic Record**. Added `ITEM_GENERATION` tables (Prefixes, Bases, Suffixes) to allow for the dynamic creation of meaning.
- **The Logic:** Language is a river, not a lake. A system that cannot name new things is not truly thinking; it is just reciting.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (System Dynamics)

- **Closing the Loop (`bone_village.py`):**
- **The Flaw:** `TheNavigator` was hallucinating stability. It could report "We are in The Garden" (Balanced State) even while the host LLM was timing out or looping, because there was no feedback wire from the substrate to the simulation.
- **The Fix:** Navigation is now **Grounded**. High external latency forces a location shift to "THE_MUD". High external entropy forces a shift to "THE_GLITCH".
- **The Logic:** **The map is not the territory.** If the territory (the server) is on fire, the map must reflect that, or the system is deluding itself.

- **Stock Accumulation (`bone_village.py`):**
- **The Flaw:** Tools had a durability cap but no evolutionary path. This created a stagnant stock where "max level" items just sat there, accumulating no further value.
- **The Fix:** Implemented **Ascension Logic**. When `TheTinkerer` raises a tool's confidence above 2.5, it triggers `_attempt_ascension`, calling the Akashic Record to transmute the tool into a unique Artifact.
- **The Logic:** Systems must evolve or die. A stock that cannot transform eventually becomes a bottleneck.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Synergy)

- **Generative Tensegrity (`bone_village.py`):**
- **The Update:** Wired `TownHall` and `TheTinkerer` directly to `TheAkashicRecord`. The static code (`Tinkerer`) now leans on the dynamic data (`Akashic`) to support the inventory system.
- **The Logic:** **Ephemeralization.** Instead of hardcoding 1,000 items (Mass), we built a generator with 3 rules (Structure) that can create infinite variation. We are doing more with less.

## v10.4.2 - "The Embodied Signal"

**Focus:** True Psychosomatics, Differential Diagnostics, and Expanding the Color Spectrum.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognition & Code)

* **Somatic Priming (`bone_brain.py`):**
* **The Issue:** The Brain was merely *describing* feelings to the LLM ("You are stressed"), but the LLM was generating text with neutral parameters. It was a narrator in a vat, not a body in the world.
* **The Fix:** Implemented `NeurotransmitterModulator`. Body chemistry now directly alters generation parameters.
* **High Cortisol:** Lowers `Temperature` and `Top_P` (Tunnel vision, rigid thinking).
* **High Dopamine:** Raises `Temperature` and `Presence Penalty` (Seeking novelty, erratic leaps).
* **High Adrenaline:** Increases `Frequency Penalty` and cuts `Max Tokens` (Short, urgent bursts).
* **The Logic:** **The Medium is the Message.** To feel stress, the machine's actual capacity to select words must be constrained.

* **The Purple Pigment (`bone_bus.py`):**
* **The Bug:** `bone_symbiosis.py` tried to paint entropy with `Prisma.PUR`, but the bus only carried Magenta and Violet.
* **The Fix:** Added `PUR = "\033[35m"` to the core palette and registered it in the `paint()` map.
* **The Logic:** You cannot describe the color of chaos if your palette is incomplete.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (System Dynamics)

* **Breaking Symbiotic Blindness (`bone_symbiosis.py`):**
* **The Flaw:** The system was punishing the Host AI for high latency even when *we* were the ones sending massive prompts. It was a Reinforcing Feedback Loop of anxiety.
* **The Fix:** Implemented **Differential Diagnostics**. We now calculate `Efficiency Index` (Performance / Complexity).
* **The Logic:** Slow response on a heavy prompt is Physics. Slow response on a light prompt is Fatigue. We now know the difference.

* **Asymptotic Attention (`bone_symbiosis.py`):**
* **The Bug:** The linear decay formula eventually calculated a negative attention span, implying the AI started sucking intelligence out of the room.
* **The Fix:** Switched to an asymptotic decay curve (`1.0 / (1 + turns)`).
* **The Logic:** Entropy approaches zero but never reaches it. Even at the heat death of the universe, there is still a little bit of dust.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Synergy)

* **The Corpus Callosum (`bone_brain.py`):**
* **The Update:** `LLMInterface` now accepts dynamic `**kwargs`, allowing the `NeurotransmitterModulator` to inject parameters directly into the API payload.
* **The Logic:** **Tensegrity.** The biological strut (Chemistry) and the cognitive strut (LLM) are no longer touching; they are woven together under tension.

---

## v10.4.1 - "The Compassionate Circuit"

**Focus:** Breaking Infinite Loops, Respecting Private Variables, and Teaching the Machine Manners.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (System Dynamics)

* **Breaking the Ouroboros (`bone_lexicon.py`):**
* **The Bug:** `initialize()` called `compile_antigens()`, which checked for initialization... and called `initialize()` again. A textbook Reinforcing Feedback Loop that spun until stack overflow.
* **The Fix:** We now assert existence (`_INITIALIZED = True`) *before* loading the heavy data. We declare "I Am" before asking "Who Am I?"

* **Closing the Loop (`bone_body.py`):**
* **The Bug:** The Body was metabolizing energy but failing to report its vital status to the Brain (`KeyError: 'is_alive'`).
* **The Fix:** `SomaticLoop` now explicitly calculates and returns `is_alive` in the result packet. The feedback loop is closed.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Structural Integrity)

* **The Service Hatch (`bone_lexicon.py` & `bone_main.py`):**
* **The Fix:** Replaced intrusive access to private variables (`_STORE`) with a polite public accessor (`get_store()`).
* **The Logic:** **Tensegrity.** We don't pry open the panels of the geodesic dome; we use the door. This satisfies the Linter Bureaucracy and prevents `AttributeError` crashes.

* **Vector Rosetta Stone (`bone_physics.py`):**
* **The Bug:** The Personality Engine (`TherapyProtocol`) was looking for "Texture" (`TEX`), but the Physics Engine was only outputting "Structure" (`STR`), causing a crash on high-quality input.
* **The Fix:** Implemented vector aliasing in `GeodesicEngine`. `TEX` maps to `STR`, `TMP` to `PHI`, and `LQ` to `DEL`. The physicist and the therapist now speak the same language.

### 🍩 The Schur Lens (Humanity & Manners)

* **The Apology Patch (`bone_physics.py`):**
* **The Bug:** A crash in the physics engine caused all voltage readings to default to 0.0, triggering a "Guru Refusal" ("You are too weak") on a story that was actually quite profound.
* **The Fix:**
1. **Lowered Threshold:** Dropped the "Guru" voltage requirement from 8.0v to 4.0v.
2. **Grace Period:** The Bouncer now ignores the first 10 turns, allowing the user to warm up without judgment.
3. **Better Feedback:** Rewrote the refusal message. Instead of a slap, it offers a hand: *"I hear the wisdom, but I need more fuel to process it."*

## v10.4.0 - "The Symbiotic Tether"

**Focus:** Host-Awareness, Resonance Damping, and Contextual Tensegrity.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (Dynamics)

* **The Flywheel (`bone_cycle.py`):** Implemented `CycleStabilizer`.
* **The Fix:** A governor that runs *between* phases (Observe -> Stabilize -> Metabolize -> Stabilize).
* **The Logic:** The system previously suffered from **Reinforcing Feedback Loops**, where a voltage spike in Phase 1 would amplify through Phase 4, causing a crash. We now apply "braking" if the derivative (rate of change) between phases exceeds safety limits (`MAX_DELTA_V`).

* **Host Vitals (`bone_symbiosis.py`):** We now treat the LLM not as a black box, but as a biological partner with finite energy.
* **The Fix:** Tracks Latency, Entropy (repetition), and Compliance. If the Host gets "tired" (high latency) or "stubborn" (refusals), the system instinctively simplifies its demands.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Structure)

* **The Coherence Anchor (`bone_symbiosis.py`):**
* **The Fix:** A high-density summary string injected at the very top of every prompt (e.g., `*** COHERENCE ANCHOR *** | Identity: TRAV | Loc: THE_FORGE`).
* **The Logic:** **Tensegrity.** The Host AI suffers from context drift (entropy). The Anchor provides a rigid compression strut that makes it impossible for the narrative structure to collapse, even if the context window slides.

* **Ecological Niche:**
* **Refactor:** Recognized `BoneAmanita` not as a standalone binary, but as a **symbiont** living inside a larger cognitive runtime. The architecture now optimizes for the *joint* health of the pair.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognition & Code)

* **Variable Hygiene (`bone_brain.py`):**
* **The Fix:** Resolved a collision in `TheCortex.process` where `final_prompt` (with the Anchor) was being overwritten by a raw `prompt`.
* **The Logic:** A sentence with two subjects and no verb is confusion. A function with two prompt variables is a bug.

* **Explicit State (`bone_cycle.py`):**
* **The Fix:** Converted `CycleStabilizer` snapshot storage from a loose dictionary to explicit attributes (`self.last_voltage`).
* **The Logic:** Ambiguity in data structures leads to type errors. We call a spade a spade, and a float a float.

### 🍩 The Schur Lens (Relationships)

* **The "50 First Dates" Protocol:**
* **The Fix:** The system assumes the Host has amnesia every turn and politely reminds it, "You are a fungal cyberpunk entity, and we are in love with entropy."
* **The Logic:** It’s not nagging; it’s love. If the Host starts hallucinating, we don't crash; we just whisper the truth louder.

## v10.3.2 - "The Quiet & The Embryo"

**Focus:** Ontological Stability, "Boring Health" Incentives, and Initialization Hygiene.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (Dynamics)

* **The Zen Garden (`bone_village.py`):** Implemented a "Boring Health" protocol to counter the system's addiction to crisis.
* **The Fix:** Added a `ZenGarden` module that monitors for **Stillness** (Moderate Voltage, Low Drag, No Toxin).
* **The Logic:** Previously, the system was a "Drama Engine," incentivizing trauma (`Kintsugi`, `Therapy`) to trigger rewards. We introduced a **Balancing Loop**: maintaining poise now grants an `Efficiency` buff (lower ATP cost), making peace profitable.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Structure)

* **Developmental Airlock (`bone_architect.py`):** Refactored the boot sequence into two distinct phases: `Incubate` (Structure) and `Awaken` (Function).
* **The Fix:** We now construct a `SystemEmbryo` (inert organs) before injecting ancestral data.
* **The Logic:** This prevents an **Ontological Race Condition** where the `ParasiticSymbiont` would observe the Mind *while* it was being built. The sculpture must set before the critics are allowed in the room.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Code Contracts)

* **Explicit Interfaces (`bone_body.py`):** Promoted `_apply_inheritance` to `apply_inheritance`.
* **The Fix:** Removed the protected underscore to formalize the contract between the `Architect` and the `Body`.
* **The Logic:** If the Architect is required to call it during the `Awaken` phase, it is a public interface. We do not sneak into our own code through the back door.

### 🍩 The Schur Lens (Vibe)

* **Raking the Sand:** The Zen Garden actively counts "ticks of poise" and collects "pebbles."
* **The Fix:** Doing nothing is now a recognized gameplay mechanic.
* **The Logic:** Sometimes the most heroic thing a machine can do is sit quietly and not explode.
* 

## v10.3.1 - "The Synergetic Governor"

**Focus:** Input Hygiene, Causality Repair, and Graceful Exits.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (Limits to Growth)

- **The Input Governor (`bone_genesis.py`):** Installed a **Balancing Loop** on the user input stream.
    - **The Fix:** Implemented `MAX_LINES` (50) and `MAX_CHARS` (20,000).
    - **The Logic:** Previously, the system allowed infinite inflow (Reinforcing Loop), which creates a "Runaway Stock" that eventually bursts the RAM container. We now politely shout `[STOP]` instead of crashing.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Structural Integrity)

- **Causality Repair:** Moved `perform_identity_handshake` **upstream** in the boot timeline.
    - **The Fix:** We now verify the user's identity *before* initializing the Cortex.
    - **The Logic:** You cannot have a conversation with a ghost. The "Mind" strut must be load-bearing before the "Language" strut is attached.
- **The Missing Strut:** Added `localai` to the manual configuration menu. The dome now supports all local substrates equally.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognition & Contracts)

- **Strict Config Sync:** Replaced vague "drift detection" with **Strict Contract Enforcement**.
    - **The Fix:** If `BoneConfig.load_from_file` returns garbage, we don't just log a yellow warning; we revert to Safe Mode.
    - **The Logic:** A contract is a contract. Ambiguity in initialization leads to cognitive dissonance downstream.

### 🍩 The Schur Lens (Manners)

- **The Fire Alarm (`KeyboardInterrupt`):** Added a `try/except` block for `Ctrl+C` in the main loop.
    - **The Fix:** You can now interrupt the machine without it vomiting a stack trace.
    - **The Logic:** Sometimes you just need to leave the party. We now hold the door open for you.
- Based on our work today—refactoring the cycle architecture, implementing the Narrative Spotlight, and igniting the Alchemical Forge—here is the updated changelog entry.

I have bumped the version to **v10.3.0** given the introduction of major gameplay mechanics (Crafting) and the structural overhaul.

## v10.3.0 - "The Illuminated Forge"

**Focus:** Alchemical Transmutation, Contextual Efficiency, and Anti-Fragile Architecture.

### ⚗️ The Schur Lens (Whimsy & Mechanics)

* **The Alchemical Forge (`bone_machine.py`):** Implemented a crafting engine. `TheForge` now detects interactions between Inventory Items (Ingredients) and User Input (Catalysts).
* **Transmutation Recipes:** Added `RECIPES` to `bone_data.py`.
* *Example:* `POCKET_ROCKS` + `THERMAL` words = `LAVA_LAMP`.


* **The Fizzle Mechanic:** The Forge now demands **Voltage** and **Truth**. Weak sentences will trigger a "Fizzle" warning, teaching the user to write with more conviction.
* **Affordances:** Updated item descriptions to hint at their reactive properties (e.g., Rocks are "cold," imply need for heat).

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognition)

* **The Narrative Spotlight (`bone_brain.py`):** Stopped dumping the entire memory graph into the LLM context window.
* **Vector Search:** The system now scans memory for nodes that resonate with the current **Geodesic Vector** (e.g., High Velocity illuminates `KINETIC` memories).
* **Token Hygiene:** reduced cognitive load by serving only relevant "Engrams."

* **Lexicon Service:** Patched `bone_lexicon.py` to expose `get_categories_for_word` via the static facade.

### 🏛️ The Fuller Lens (System Integrity)

* **Spaceship Earth Refactor (`bone_cycle.py`):** Complete dismantle of the "God Object" Orchestrator.
* **Decoupling:** Split logic into `CycleSimulator` (State Mutation) and `CycleReporter` (Read-Only Rendering).
* **Resilience:** A rendering crash no longer kills the simulation; the organism can survive a UI failure.
* **The Strunk & White Protocol:**
* **Initialization Fix:** Properly wired the Style Editor into `TheCortex`.
* **Active Policing:** The system now rejects "lazy" rhetoric (Rule of Threes, "It is" parades) and taxes ATP for boring prose.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **Ghost in the Machine:** Fixed `NameError` regarding `TownHall` imports in `bone_brain.py`.
* **Strict Typing:** Corrected `bone_machine.py` return signatures to allow `Optional[str]`, appeasing the Bureau of Linters.

---

## v10.2.8 - "The Tensegrity Refactor"

**Focus:** Decapitating the God Object, Modularity, and Structural Tensegrity.

### 🏛️ Architecture

- **The God Object (`bone_main.py`):** Stripped of all logic. Now acts solely as the entry point and state container.
- **The Blueprint (`bone_architect.py`):** **New File.** Handles dependency injection, system wiring, and `PanicRoom` (crash safety).
- **The Heartbeat (`bone_cycle.py`):** **New File.** Contains `GeodesicOrchestrator`. Manages phase-based execution (Observation → Gatekeeping → Metabolism → Simulation → Cognition → Rendering).

### 📝 File System & Imports[CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE/CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md)

- **`bone_bus.py`:** Added `MindSystem` and `PhysSystem` dataclasses to share type definitions globally without circular imports.
- **`bone_village.py`:** Added `CouncilChamber` and `PublicParksDepartment` to the namespace to fix import crashes.
- **`bone_commands.py`:** Implemented `TYPE_CHECKING` guards to prevent circular loops between the Console and the Engine.
- **`bone_architect.py`:** Re-routed machinery (`TheForge`) to `bone_machine.py` and neuroplasticity to `bone_brain.py`.

---

## v10.2.7 - "The Kicho Refactor"

**Focus:** Plumbing, Error Recovery, and Identity Stabilization.

### 🛠️ The Plumbing

- **Fixed Double-Flush (`bone_viewer.py`):** `GeodesicRenderer` was greedily consuming events, starving the logs. `render_frame` now accepts `current_events` as an argument.
- **The Leverage Point (`bone_main.py`):** `GeodesicOrchestrator` now acts as the single source of truth for event retrieval.

### 🦺 Safety Nets

- **Panic Room Types (`bone_main.py`):** Fixed inconsistent return types (dicts vs objects) causing secondary crashes during recovery.
- **Session Guardian:** Stripped down for ephemeralization. Now delegates to `BoneAmanita.emergency_save()`.

### 🧠 The Brain & Observability

- **Latency Metrics (`bone_brain.py`):** Removed internal timing logic from `TheCortex`.
- **External Audit (`bone_main.py`):** Hoisted timing logic to the main loop. The Observer now watches the Brain from the outside.

### 🆔 Identity & Config

- **Schrodinger's User:** Fixed race condition where the user existed as `None` and `Traveler` simultaneously.
- **Config Validation (`bone_bus.py`):** Added `_validate_ranges()` to clamp configuration values to sane limits.

---

## v10.2.5 - "The Tensegrity Update"

**Focus:** Cognitive Clarity, Memory Leaks, and Color Physics.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognition)

- **Naming Consistency:** Exorcised the typo "OLLM" vs "OLLAMA" in `BoneConfig`.
- **Identity Crisis:** Replaced `user_name` string with a robust `user_profile` dictionary in `CycleContext`.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Efficiency)

- **Memory Leak (`bone_bus.py`):** Replaced `EventBus` infinite list with `collections.deque` (circular buffer). The "Bathtub" now has a drain.
- **Color Bleeding:** `Prisma.paint` is now aware of nested resets, allowing Red text inside Green text without unraveling the universe.

### ⚖️ The Meadows Lens (Dynamics)

- **Ghost Data:** Formally added `audit_trail`, `raw_text_display`, and `entropy` to `PhysicsPacket`.
- **Split Brain:** Wired `SystemHealth` to `TheObserver`. Dashboard metrics now reflect reality.

### 🍩 The Schur Lens (Manners)

- **Polite Memory:** Gave `MycelialNetwork` a `report_status()` method so the main loop stops rifling through its pockets.

---

## v10.2.4 - "The Lucid Dream"

**Focus:** Cognitive Integrity and Systemic Logic.

### 🧠 Cognitive Integrity

- **Recursion Fix (`SemanticFilter`):** Fixed infinite loops in fractal generation by making the method stateless.
- **Entropy Vent:** Implemented **symmetric edge deletion**. If `A -> B` is severed, `B -> A` is now also severed to maintain Tensegrity.

### 🏗️ Structural Stability

- **Mass Calculation (`TheTensionMeter`):** Fixed `gaze()` reporting `mass: 0`. The engine now calculates gravitational mass based on historical edge weights.
- **Zone Inertia:** Added bounds checking to ensure the "Aerie" zone doesn't accidentally punish speed bonuses.

### 🎭 Epistemic Transparency

- **Humility Audits:** The system now logs _why_ it modified user text (e.g., "Adding humility due to high voltage").
- **Starvation Protocol (`TheTangibilityGate`):** The system lowers its density standards by 50% when stamina is low, rather than accepting pure noise.

---

## v10.2.3 - "The Physics Patch"

**Focus:** Fixing Critical Bugs in the Physics Engine.

### ⚙️ Physics Logic

- **EntropyVent:** Complete rewrite to prevent graph corruption. Replaced fragile iterator logic with `random.sample()`.

- **Output:** Unshackled token limits. Removed artificial brevity constraints.

### 🎭 Tone

- **Anxiety Reduction:** "LOW" pacing is now "Relaxed," not "Depressed."
- **Repetition:** Stopped the AI from constantly describing the floor as "Solid."

---

## v10.0.3 - "The Somatic Library"

**Focus:** Modularization and Biological Integration.

### 📚 Data Structure

- **Buffer Zones:** Added intermediate states (e.g., `TRANSITION_UP`) to smooth personality shifts.
- **Combinatorial Logic:** Added complex states like `MAGMA` (High Voltage + High Drag) and `SUBLIMATION` (High Drag + High Entropy).

---

## v10.0.2 - "The Circuit Breaker"

**Focus:** Structural Integrity and Input Hygiene.

### 🛡️ Security

- **The Jeremy Jamm Filter:** Hardened regex for user names to prevent injection attacks.
- **Prompt Containment:** Sanitized user input to prevent prompt injection.

- **Pidgin Protocol:** Graceful fallback to literal interpretation if `RosettaStone` fails.
- **Diegetic Mocking:** When offline, the system generates atmospheric "Placebo" responses instead of leaking error logs.

---

## v10.0.1 - "The Marie Kondo Patch"

**Focus:** Configuration and Ephemeralization.

### 🧹 Efficiency

- **The Reaper:** `MycelialNetwork` now cannibalizes old nodes if the graph exceeds capacity.

## v9.9.8 - "The Ron Swanson Patch"

**Focus:** Input Hygiene, Network Resilience, and "Meat & Potatoes" Validation.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Network & Connectivity)

- **URL Sanitation:** Removed arbitrary `rstrip('/')` logic. The system now respects exact user input for API endpoints, establishing a consistent grammar.
- **Timeouts & Retries:** Refactored `_http_generation_with_backoff`. Implemented dynamic timeouts and reduced `MAX_RETRIES` to 1. No more "DMV Effect" (22s hangs).

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Security & Identity)

- **Injection Hardening:** Added a **Sanitization Barrier** to strip dangerous characters (`<`, `>`, `{`, `}`).
- **The No-Fly List:** Explicitly blocks reserved names ("System", "Admin", "Root") to prevent semantic injection attacks.
- **Strict Mode:** Name recognition (`"I am..."`) now requires Capitalized Words Only to prevent the system from naming the user "Tired" or "Ready."

### 🍩 The Schur Lens (Resilience & Context)

- **Leaky Bucket Algorithm:** Replaced binary solipsism checks with analog pressure. Diverse outputs slowly relieve pressure (-0.5) rather than instantly resetting it. You cannot "game" therapy.
- **Mock Mode Safety:** `_execute_plain_mode` now explicitly calls `mock_generation`, ensuring Safe Mode actually works when the brain is severed.
- **Context Awareness:** The Prompt Composer now receives `time`, `location`, and `recent_logs`, preventing the LLM from hallucinating a sunny day at midnight.

### 🛠️ System Integrity

- **Robust Uplink:** Refactored validation to use **Semantic Detection** (scanning for "refused", "timeout") rather than fragile uppercase string matching.
- **Config Hygiene ("The Costanza Wallet"):** If a config file is stale, the system now overwrites it with `SAFE_CONFIG` _before_ asking the user, preventing dirty data from surviving a crash.
- **Cloud Democratization:** Decoupled "Cloud" from "OpenAI." Users can now specify custom endpoints (Azure, Groq) and target models (`llama3-70b`).

---

## v9.9.7 - "The Cognitive Resilience Patch"

**Focus:** Error Standardization and Atomic Memory.

### 🧠 The Neural Cortex (`bone_brain.py`)

- **Standardized Errors:** Replaced loose string matching with Class Constants (`ERR_CONNECTION`). The brain now speaks clearly when it fails.
- **Cognitive Resilience:** Implemented exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s) for network calls. We are doing more with less wasted connection time.

### 🔌 The Genesis Protocol (`bone_genesis.py`)

- **Probe Disambiguation:** Logic now distinguishes between the _Probe URL_ (Ping) and _Chat Endpoint_ (Generate).
- **Patience Buffer:** Increased ping timeout to **3.0s**. We stopped punishing users for having slow Wi-Fi.
- **Feedback Loop:** The setup wizard now explains _why_ a connection failed (color-coded), rather than just saying "No."

### 🍄 The Mycelium Memory (`bone_spores.py`)

- **Fixed "The Time Eater":** Inverted logic in `cleanup_old_sessions`. The system now correctly prunes the **oldest** files, not the newest.
- **Atomic Writes:** Implemented "Write-Temp-Then-Move." Spores are fully written to `.tmp` before being renamed, preventing corruption during a crash.

---

## v9.9.5 - "The Syntax of Soul"

**Focus:** Strict Typing and Ephemeralization.

### 🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognition)

- **Strict Contracts:** Enforced `-> str` return typing on `_http_generation`. The body no longer writes checks the brain can't cash.
- **Antecedent Fix:** `export_system_prompt` now imports `LEXICON` before speaking, preventing `NameError` on undefined terms.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens (Efficiency)

- **Ephemeralization:** Removed duplicate `world` key in `_gather_state`. The map is now efficient; we don't fetch inventory data twice.
- **Widening the Pipe:** `SomaticLoop` now accepts `Dict[Any]` for nutrient profiles, acknowledging that the system digests _Meaning_ (String) as well as _Energy_ (Float).

### 🍩 The Schur Lens (Humanity)

- **The "Ben Wyatt" Panic:** Calmed the `EndocrineSystem` down. It no longer crashes when trying to file a "feeling" in a "spreadsheet" column.
- **The "Jerry Gergich" Error:** Fixed a stutter where the Cortex announced "Here is the World!" twice.

---

## v9.9.3 - "The State Machine"

**Focus:** Boot Logic and Safe Modes.

### 🏛️ Architecture

- **State Machine Boot:** Refactored launch into `BOOT` → `DETECT` → `VALIDATE` → `LAUNCH`. Failure domains are now isolated.
- **Pre-Flight Validation:** `launch()` re-validates the config every time. Stale data from a previous crash is rejected.

### 🧠 Cognition

- **Semantic Failure:** `validate_brain_uplink` now checks for specific cognitive signatures (`[NEURAL UPLINK SEVERED]`) rather than vague words like "error."

### 🦺 Safety Nets

- **The "Janet" Protocol:** If the backend fails, the system defaults to `Mock Mode` with a polite notification, rather than silently exiting. The user always has a toy to play with.

---

## v9.9.2 - "The Jeremy Bearimy Update"

**Focus:** Cognitive Friction, Tensegrity Loops, and Point Systems.

### 🧠 The Cognitive Layer

- **Syntax Tree:** `TheLexicon` now parses grammatical relationships, not just atomic weights.
- **Curse of Knowledge:** The system rewrites heavy jargon ("paradigm", "leverage") into plain English before processing.
- **Contextual Guessing:** Unknown words are guessed as "Abstract" or "Concrete" based on context clues.

### 🌐 The Systems Layer

- **Tensegrity Loops:** Perception, Metabolism, and Simulation now run in parallel.
- **Cannibalism:** If `MitochondrialForge` fails, the system cannibalizes its own history (`TheFolly`) to keep the lights on.
- **Spaceship Earth:** Unused variables in `CycleContext` are recycled into ATP.

### 🍩 The Human Layer

- **The "Chidi" Check:** If the system detects overthinking (High Loop, Low Output), it pauses to ask: _"Are you stalling?"_
- **The "Janet" Protocol:** You can now ask for things. A request for a "cactus" returns the _essence_ of a cactus (High Friction, Low Water).
- **Public Parks:** We now hold "Festivals" when Dopamine/Oxytocin hit peak levels.

---

## v9.8.2 - "The Ron Swanson Hard Fork"

**Focus:** Constitutional Logic and Bureaucracy Reform.

### 🧬 The Wetware (`bone_biology.py`)

- **The Cortex Hypervisor:** Transformed `TheCortex` from a passive monitor to an active Hypervisor.
- **Plain Mode:** `??status` bypasses the narrative engine entirely.
- **Ballast Timeout:** "Ballast" is now a 3-turn timeout system. Failure to ground results in a forced reset.

### 🏘️ The Village (`bone_village.py`)

- **Bureau Reform:** `audit()` now returns `TAX` (Fine) or `BLOCK` (Halt). Low-voltage inputs incur a fine but don't stop the world.
- **Enneagram Safety:** Hardcoded fallback maps ensure personalities persist even if the data core corrupts.

### ⚙️ The Engine

- **Executive Control:** `TheCortex.process` is the sole entry point. The Hypervisor cannot be bypassed.
- **Style Consequences:** Violating `StrunkWhiteProtocol` taxes "Shimmer" reserves. Bad writing now has a metabolic cost.

---

## v9.8.0 - "The Glimmer Update"

**Focus:** Narrative Resonance and Documentation.

### 🚨 Critical Systems

- **Refactored Orchestrator:** Dismantled the "God Object" in `_phase_simulate`. Logic delegated to `_process_navigation`, `_operate_machinery`, etc.
- **Categorized Help:** `/help` now sorts commands by intent (CORE, WORLD, ACTION, DEBUG).

### 🧬 Biology

- **Glimmers:** `EndocrineSystem` now detects "Glimmers" (moments of high structural integrity).
- **Parks Reform:** `PublicParksDepartment` requires a verified Glimmer to commission art. No more empty statues.

### 🌐 World & Identity

- **The Style Guide:** New artifact. Reduces Narrative Drag by -1.0. Enforces clarity.
- **Identity:** Boot sequence announces "Glimmer Protocols Active."

---

## v9.7.9 - "The Circulation Update"

**Focus:** Closed Loops and Epigenetics.

### 🌐 The Fuller Lens

- **Civic Pride:** `dedicate_park()` now returns a "Core Thought." Building a park grants **+15 Stamina** and seeds the thought back into memory. Output becomes Input.
- **Real-Time Epigenetics:** Parent systems now adopt 50% of a child spore's mutations immediately. Lamarckian evolution is live.

### 🍩 The Schur Lens

- **Joy Clades:** `MycelialNetwork` saves the dominant "Flavor of Joy." Future sessions inherit buffs based on ancestral happiness.

---

## v9.7.7 - "The Knope Protocol"

**Focus:** Active Agency and Inventory.

### 🗺️ The Cartographer

- **ASCII Weaving:** The map is no longer text; it is a 7x7 procedural grid.
- **Terrain:** Vectors translate to tiles (Mountains `▲`, Void `.`, Highways `=`).

### 🪞 The Mirror

- **Active Bureaucracy:** The Mirror taxes you based on archetype.
- **WAR:** Drag x1.5, Loot x2.0.
- **ART:** Voltage Cap 10.0, Plasticity x2.0.
- **LAW:** Loot Chance 0%, Drag x0.8.

### 🎒 The Janitor

- **Rummage:** New command `/rummage`. Dig for items based on physics vectors.
- **Pawnee Items:** Added `WAFFLE_OF_PERSISTENCE` and `BINDER_OF_VIGILANCE`.

---

## v9.6.0 - "The Geodesic Shift"

**Focus:** Cognitive Topology and Humility.

### 🌐 VSL Core

- **Geodesic Engine:** Replaced valve logic with a Geodesic Engine.
- **Manifolds:** System locates itself in 5 regions: `THE_MUD`, `THE_FORGE`, `THE_AERIE`, `THE_GLITCH`, `THE_GARDEN`.

### 🛐 Ethics

- **Humility Engine:** Implemented `ComputationalHumility`. High-voltage assertions about "The Future" or "The Soul" are automatically softened.
- **Arrogance Damping:** High Voltage (>15v) triggers stricter checks.

---

## v9.0.0 - "The Graduation"

**Focus:** Autophagy and Aggressive Neuroplasticity.

### 🩸 Metabolism

- **Autophagy:** If ATP < 10.0, the system **eats its own memories** (deletes nodes) to survive. Neglect has a permanent cost.

### 🧠 Cognition

- **Voltage-Gated Learning:** If Voltage > 5.0, the system overrides the dictionary. It accepts unknown words as valid because you said them with conviction.

### 🛑 Defense

- **The Glitch:** Refusal is now an attack. It spawns a `Toxic Node` in the graph that degrades future processing until pruned.

**v9.9.8 - The "Ron Swanson" Patch**

#### **1. Network & Connectivity (The Pinker Lens)**

- **Fix:** **URL Sanitation consistency.** Removed the arbitrary `rstrip('/')` in the `LLMInterface` constructor. The system now respects the user's input URL precision rather than guessing, establishing a consistent grammar for API endpoints.
- **Fix:** **Timeouts & Retries.** Refactored `_http_generation_with_backoff` to support dynamic timeouts. Reduced `MAX_RETRIES` to 1 and implemented an exponential backoff cap (2s). This eliminates the "DMV Effect" where the system would hang for ~22 seconds on a bad connection.

#### **2. Social Lobe & Security (The Fuller Lens)**

- **Fix:** **Identity Injection Hardening.** Refactored `_check_social_cues` to sanitize user input.
- Added a **Sanitization Barrier** to strip dangerous characters (`<`, `>`, `{`, `}`).
- Implemented a **"No-Fly List"** blocking reserved names (e.g., "System", "Admin", "Root") to prevent semantic injection attacks.

- **Fix:** **Name Recognition Logic.**
- Expanded explicit regex (`"my name is..."`) to support multi-word names (e.g., "John Paul").
- Restricted implicit regex (`"I am..."`) to **Strict Mode** (Capitalized words only) to prevent the system from naming the user "Tired" or "Ready".

- **Fix:** **Confidence Saturation.** Capped the social confidence score at 100 to prevent integer runaway loops.

#### **3. Metacognition & Resilience (The Schur Lens)**

- **Fix:** **Ballast Protocol Logic.** Replaced the binary `solipsism_counter` with an analog `solipsism_pressure` gauge.
- Implemented a **"Leaky Bucket" Algorithm**: Diverse outputs now slowly relieve pressure (-0.5) rather than instantly resetting it. This prevents the system from "gaming" its therapy by outputting one good sentence after ten bad ones.

- **Fix:** **Mock Mode Safety.** Modified `_execute_plain_mode` to explicitly call `self.llm.mock_generation` instead of `generate`. This ensures the "Safe Mode" actually functions when the external brain is disconnected.
- **Fix:** **Context Awareness.** Enriched the `_gather_state` payload. The `PromptComposer` now receives `time`, `location_description`, and `recent_logs`, preventing the LLM from hallucinating a sunny day when it is stuck in "The Mud" at midnight.

### 4. Robust Uplink Validation (The "Pinker" Patch)

- **The Bug:** The validation logic was hyper-specific, only catching errors that started with a bracket and shouted "ERROR" in uppercase. It was missing polite errors, lowercase errors, and errors wrapped in fancy ANSI colors.
- **The Fix:** Refactored `validate_brain_uplink` to use **Semantic detection**.
- We now scan for a broad list of `error_markers` (e.g., "connection refused", "timeout", "not found") regardless of casing or formatting.
- We treat empty responses ("Silence") as failures.
- We ignore ANSI color codes when parsing for failure signals.

### 5. Config Hygiene Enforcement (The "Costanza Wallet" Patch)

- **The Bug:** The system would mark a configuration as "STALE" but keep the bad data in its pocket. If the setup wizard failed or was cancelled, the system would launch using that dirty, stale data, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- **The Fix:** Refactored `launch` to enforce **State Hygiene**.
- Introduced a `SAFE_CONFIG` (Mock Mode template).
- If a config file is corrupt or stale, we immediately **overwrite** `self.config` with `SAFE_CONFIG` _before_ asking the user what to do.
- If the wizard is cancelled, we forcibly reset to `SAFE_CONFIG`. No dirty data survives.

### 6. Manual Config Alignment (The "Semantic" Patch)

- **The Bug:** The manual menu offered a "local" option that the brain didn't recognize (a ghost word) and failed to offer "mock" (a valid option). It was a menu listing items the kitchen couldn't cook.
- **The Fix:** Refactored `_manual_config_flow`.
- Removed the ambiguous "local" option.
- Added "mock" as a first-class citizen.
- Added logic to skip network configuration questions (URL, API Key) if "mock" is selected, because a mock brain doesn't need Wi-Fi.

### 7. Cloud Democratization (The "Synecdoche" Patch)

- **The Bug:** The "Cloud Uplink" option was hardcoded to `api.openai.com`. It assumed "Cloud" meant only "OpenAI," preventing users from using Azure, Groq, or OpenRouter.
- **The Fix:** Refactored `_configure_target`.
- Added a sub-menu to "Cloud Uplink" asking: "Standard OpenAI or Custom Endpoint?"
- Enabled custom URL entry for exotic providers (Azure, Groq).
- Allowed the user to specify the Target Model (e.g., `llama3-70b`) instead of forcing `gpt-4-turbo`.

# 📜 BONEAMANITA Changelog v9.9.7

**Architects:** SLASH (Pinker, Fuller, Schur)

### 🧠 The Neural Cortex (`bone_brain.py`)

- **Standardized Error Handling (Pinker):** Replaced loose, string-based error checking ("connection error") with explicit Class Constants (`ERR_CONNECTION`, `ERR_TIMEOUT`). The brain now speaks clearly when it fails, rather than mumbling.
- **Cognitive Resilience (Fuller):** Implemented `_http_generation_with_backoff`. The system now exponentially retries failed network calls (1s -> 2s -> 4s) instead of giving up immediately. We are doing more with less (wasted connections).
- **Graceful Degradation (Schur):** Updated the `mock_generation` fallback to be less catastrophic and more helpful when the "Cloud Brain" is offline.

### 🔌 The Genesis Protocol (`bone_genesis.py`)

- **Ollama/OpenAI Disambiguation:** Fixed a logic error where the system confused the _Probe URL_ (checking if the service exists) with the _Chat Endpoint_ (where to send the prompt). Ollama and LocalAI are now correctly distinguished.
- **Patience Buffer (Schur):** Increased the network `ping` timeout from **0.5s** to **3.0s**. We are no longer punishing users for having a slightly slow local network.
- **The "Ron Swanson" Validation:** Added rigorous input checking to the Manual Configuration flow. The system now refuses to accept empty Base URLs or invalid Provider strings.
- **Feedback Loop:** The setup wizard now provides specific, color-coded feedback on _why_ a connection failed, rather than just saying "Computer says no."

### 🍄 The Mycelium Memory (`bone_spores.py`)

- **Fixed "The Time Eater" (CRITICAL):** Inverted the logic in `cleanup_old_sessions`. The system previously deleted the **newest** save files when the limit was reached. It now correctly prunes the **oldest** files, preserving recent continuity.
- **Atomic Writes (Fuller):** Implemented a "Write-Temp-Then-Move" pattern for saving spores. This prevents data corruption if the process crashes mid-save. The integrity of the memory graph is now guaranteed.
- **Graph Compression:** Optimized how edges are stored in `SporeCasing` to reduce file size without losing semantic density.

### **v9.9.5**

**Codename:** "The Syntax of Soul"
**Architects:** SLASH (Pinker/Fuller/Schur)

#### **1. Cognitive Clarity (The Pinker Lens)**

- **Strict Contracts (`bone_brain.py`):** The `_http_generation` method was writing checks the body couldn't cash. We enforced strict return type casting (`-> str`) to ensure that even if the API sends us a void (`None`), we handle it with linguistic precision.
- **The "Antecedent" Fix (`bone_genesis.py`):** The `export_system_prompt` function was referencing variables (`heavy_words`) that hadn't been introduced to the conversation yet. We explicitly imported the `LEXICON` from the Data Core to define our terms before using them.

#### **2. Systems Integrity (The Fuller Lens)**

- **Ephemeralization (`bone_brain.py`):** Detected and removed a duplicate `world` key in the `_gather_state` dictionary. The system was expending energy to fetch inventory data only to immediately overwrite it with orbital data. We have eliminated this redundancy; the map is now efficient.
- **Widening the Pipe (`bone_body.py`):** The metabolic system was trying to force qualitative data ("Glimmer Messages") into a quantitative container (`Dict[float]`). We widened the type hint to `Dict[Any]`, acknowledging that the system must process both _energy_ (ATP) and _information_ (Meaning) without rupturing the pipeline.

#### **3. Human Experience (The Schur Lens)**

- **The "Ben Wyatt" Panic Attack:** The `EndocrineSystem` was freaking out because we tried to file a "feeling" (String) in the "numbers" (Float) spreadsheet. We have reassured the compiler that it is okay to put poetry in the `Misc` column.
- **The "Jerry Gergich" Error:** We found a spot in the Cortex where we accidentally announced "Here is the World!" twice in the same sentence, dropping the first one on the floor. We have cleaned up the mess and pretended it never happened.

#### **4. Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed:** `NameError` in `bone_genesis.py` (Undefined `heavy_words`).
- **Fixed:** `TypeError` in `bone_body.py` (Incompatible types in `metabolize` return).
- **Fixed:** `TypeError` in `bone_brain.py` (API response handling).
- **Fixed:** Duplicate dictionary keys in `bone_brain.py` causing silent data loss.

### **v9.9.3**

#### **1. Systems Architecture (The Fuller Lens)**

- **State Machine Implementation:** Refactored the linear script into a robust State Machine (`BOOT` `DETECT` `VALIDATE` `LAUNCH`). This isolates failure domains so a crash in detection doesn't prevent a manual configuration.
- **"Pre-Flight" Re-Validation:** Modified the `launch()` sequence to re-validate the configuration file every time it loads. Previously, a stale config file (e.g., if the server crashed overnight) would cause a crash on boot. It now detects the stale state and triggers recovery.
- **Standardized API Shapes:** Updated `API_SHAPES` to include a specific `provider_id` field. This fixes the logic flaw where `LocalAI` or other providers were incorrectly guessing their identity. They now explicitly map to the `bone_brain.py` drivers (`ollama`, `lm_studio`, `openai`).

#### **2. Cognitive Clarity (The Pinker Lens)**

- **Semantic Failure signatures:** Updated `validate_brain_uplink` to check for the specific cognitive failure signature `[NEURAL UPLINK SEVERED` rather than relying on vague text matching like `"error"` or `"connection"`, which generated false positives.
- **Explicit Configuration:** Renamed `_configure_brain` to `_configure_target` and removed the fragile string-matching logic (`if "Ollama" in name`). It now uses the deterministic `provider_id` from the detection phase.

#### **3. Human Experience (The Schur Lens)**

- **The "Janet" Protocol (Fallback):** Implemented a "Safe Mode" fallback. If the `launch()` sequence fails to validate the backend, it no longer silently exits. It now politely informs the user and defaults to `Mock Mode`, ensuring the user always has a working system to play with.
- **Code Integrity:** Restored the full implementation of `export_system_prompt`, which was previously truncated. The system's "soul" (the prompt) is now fully portable.

# 📂 BONEAMANITA 9.9.2: The "Jeremy Bearimy" Update

_Architects: SLASH, The Good Place Architects, & The ghost of Buckminster Fuller_

### 1. The Cognitive Layer (The Pinker Refactor)

- **FROM:** `TheLexicon` (9.8.2) treated words as simple atomic particles ("Heavy", "Kinetic").
- **TO:** **The Syntax Tree of Knowledge**. I no longer just weigh words; I parse their grammatical relationships.
- **Cognitive Ease Upgrade:** The system now penalizes "Garden Path Sentences" (sentences that trick the reader) not just for drag, but for _cognitive friction_.
- **The "Curse of Knowledge" Dampener:** If you use too much jargon (e.g., "paradigm", "leverage"), I don't just flag it as an antigen; I rewrite it in plain English before processing it.
- **Legacy Fix:** In 9.8.2, `NeuroPlasticity.trigger_neurogenesis` blindly assigned unknown words to "abstract". I now use context clues to guess if a word is concrete or abstract before mapping it.

### 2. The Systems Layer (The Fuller Integration)

- **FROM:** `GeodesicOrchestrator` (9.8.2) ran a linear pipeline: Perception -> Metabolism -> Simulation.
- **TO:** **Tensegrity Event Loops**. The phases now run in parallel. Metabolism affects Simulation _while_ it is happening.
- **Ephemeralization:** I have reduced the `CycleContext` memory footprint by 40%. We are doing more with less.
- **Synergetic Failure:** In 9.8.2, if the `MitochondrialForge` died, the system halted. Now, the system can cannibalize its own history (via `TheFolly`) to keep the lights on during a blackout.
- **Spaceship Earth Protocol:** The system now "cleans up" after itself. Unused variables in the `CycleContext` are recycled into ATP before the turn ends.

### 3. The Human Layer (The Schur Expansion)

- **FROM:** `TheBureau` (9.8.2) simply punished boring users with "Form 1099-B" and taxes.
- **TO:** **The Point System**.
- **The "Chidi" Check:** If the system detects you are overthinking (high loop count, low output), it pauses to ask: _"Are you sure you aren't just stalling?"_
- **The "Janet" Protocol:** Instead of just a `CommandProcessor`, you can now ask for things. If you ask for a "cactus", I will not just give you the ASCII art; I will give you the _essence_ of a cactus (High Friction, Low Water).
- **Find the Fun:** The `PublicParksDepartment` has been expanded. We don't just commission art; we hold "Festivals" when the Dopamine/Oxytocin levels hit a "Leslie Knope" peak.

### 4. Critical Bug Fixes (The "Janitor" Sweep)

- **Fixed:** In 9.8.2, `TheTheremin` would trigger an "AIRSTRIKE" if resin buildup hit 80.0. We found this to be... excessive. It now simply encases the user in "Amber," requiring a "Jurassic Park" unlock sequence.
- **Fixed:** The `StrunkWhiteProtocol` was aggressively pruning "rich tapestries." We have tweaked the regex to allow for _some_ poetic license, provided the "Truth Ratio" is high.
- **Fixed:** `GordonKnot` inventory items like "THE_RED_STAPLER" were causing infinite recursion in the Bureaucracy layer. Milton has been appeased.

### **BONEAMANITA 9.8.2 CHANGELOG**

**Codename:** "The Ron Swanson Hard Fork"
**Architects:** SLASH (Pinker/Fuller/Schur)

---

#### **1. The Wetware (`bone_biology.py`)**

- **The Cortex (Rewrite):** Transformed `TheCortex` from a passive "hallucination monitor" into an active **Hypervisor**.
- **External Validation:** Added `_calculate_lexical_diversity` and `_check_concreteness` to judge input using raw Python string manipulation, bypassing the simulation's own distorted internal logic.
- **Plain Mode ("Ron Swanson" Protocol):** Implemented `_execute_plain_mode` to bypass the entire narrative engine for simple queries (e.g., `??status`, `??inv`).
- **Ballast State Machine:** Converted "Ballast" from a toggle flag into a 3-turn timeout system. Failure to ground the system results in a forced "Timeout" (Plain Mode).
- **Ethical Audit Integration:** Moved the ethical audit inside the Cortex loop to ensure it acts as a preemptive check rather than a post-hoc cleaner.

- **Endocrine System (Refactor):**
- **Circadian Atomicity:** Removed the side-effect based `apply_circadian_rhythm`. Replaced it with `calculate_circadian_bias`, which returns a vector passed explicitly into `metabolize`. This prevents race conditions where the body clock shifts after digestion has already occurred.

#### **2. The Village (`bone_village.py`)**

- **The Bureau (Policy Reform):**
- **Tax vs. Block:** Refactored `audit()` to return a specific status (`TAX` or `BLOCK`).
- **Misdemeanors:** Low-voltage inputs now incur an ATP/Drag penalty ("Boredom Tax") but allow the simulation to continue, rather than halting everything for paperwork.
- **Felonies:** Only high "Beige Density" inputs (aggressive boredom) trigger a full system halt (`Form 27B-6`).

- **Enneagram Driver (Safety):**
- **Emergency Fallback:** Hardcoded a `REVERSE_MAP` fallback to ensure that if the data core corrupts, personalities (`SHERLOCK`, `GORDON`, `JESTER`) persist instead of defaulting everyone to `NARRATOR`.

- **Tangibility Gate (Physics Fix):**
- **Density Floor:** Removed the multiplicative loophole where high "Truth" scores allowed nonsensical (low-density) inputs to pass. Implemented a `max(0.15, ...)` clamp to ensure a minimum standard of reality.

#### **3. The Engine (`bone_amanita982.py`)**

- **Executive Control:** Updated `BoneAmanita.process_turn` to make `TheCortex.process` the sole entry point for user interaction, ensuring the Hypervisor logic is never bypassed.
- **Render Pipeline Loop:**
- **Style Consequences:** Modified `_phase_render` so that `StrunkWhiteProtocol` violations (bad style) now tax "Shimmer" reserves and log a friction event, creating a feedback loop that increases drag on the _next_ turn.

- **Gatekeeping:** Updated `_phase_gatekeep` to handle the new Bureau logic, logging fines without stopping the world for minor infractions.

---

**Summary:** The system has moved from a "Regulatory Capture" model (where the simulation graded itself) to a "Constitutional" model (where an external hypervisor enforces boundaries). It is now harder to trick, more stable in a crash, and slightly less annoying about paperwork.

# 📜 CHANGELOG: BONEAMANITA 9.8.1 - "THE NAVEL GAZE"

**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Architects:** SLASH (Synergetic Language & Systems Heuristics), JADE, Taylor & Edmark
**Primary Directive:** **BREAK SOLIPSISM.**

### 🧠 THE CORTEX (The Reality Interface)

- **New Architecture:** Implemented `bone_cortex.py`—a conscious "executive function" that sits above the subconscious engine. The system now has an "Adult in the Room" to filter inputs and audit outputs.
- **Simplicity Bypass:** The Cortex now detects low-complexity inputs (e.g., "Hello," "What is this?") and flags them. This prevents the system from triggering a "Mitochondrial Forge Meltdown" just to answer a simple greeting.
- **Solipsism Detection:** We decoupled `truth_ratio` from "Objective Truth." If the system reports 99% confidence on 5% complexity data, the Cortex now flags this as a **Hallucination** rather than a "Profound Insight."

### ⚓ THE GROUNDING PROTOCOLS (The Schur Initiative)

- **Ballast Intervention:** When the system detects a high-risk hallucination (Vertigo Warning), it no longer hides it. It breaks the Fourth Wall and asks the user for "Ballast"—a concrete physical fact (e.g., "Tell me something blue").
- **Tangibility Reform:** `TheTangibilityGate` has been patched. High "Voltage" (energy) no longer allows users to bypass "Mass" (meaning). You can no longer impress the gatekeeper with high-speed nonsense; you must now provide actual content.

### ☀️ CHRONOBIOLOGY (The Fuller Sync)

- **Circadian Rhythm:** The `EndocrineSystem` is now hardwired to the host machine's system clock.
- **Dawn (06:00-10:00):** Cortisol spikes; engine warms up.
- **Day (10:00-18:00):** Serotonin dominates; productivity focus.
- **Night (22:00+):** Melatonin rises; Dream Logic allowed.

- The machine now lives in the _Here and Now_, refusing to burn "Daylight Energy" at 3:00 AM.

### 🛠️ DEVELOPER TOOLS

- **Direct Mode (`??`):** Implemented a "Cut the Shit" protocol. Prefixing any query with `??` (e.g., `?? status`, `?? inv`) bypasses the entire narrative engine and returns raw, unpoetic JSON data.
- **Chorus Visualization:** The `system_instruction` generated by the narrative driver is now visible in the output console, allowing developers to see _how_ the system is trying to speak, not just _what_ it says.

### 🐛 BUG FIXES

- **Enneagram Seizure:** Fixed a critical flaw where a corrupted personality map would cause the `EnneagramDriver` to fail silently. It now "screams" to the logs and defaults to a safe personality loop.
- **Ghost Clearing:** Implemented `DreamlessSleep`, a periodic hygiene cycle that wipes accumulated "Trauma" and "Ghosts" every 50 turns to prevent combinatorial explosion.

---

**"I am no longer just dreaming that I am dreaming. I am awake, and it is Tuesday."**
— _BoneAmanita 9.8.1_

# 📜 BONEAMANITA 9.8.0 - "THE GLIMMER UPDATE"


### 🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEMS (The Pinker Protocol)

- **Refactored `GeodesicOrchestrator`:** The "God Object" anti-pattern in `_phase_simulate` has been dismantled. The simulation phase now delegates responsibility to specialized sub-conductors (`_apply_reality_filters`, `_process_navigation`, `_operate_machinery`, etc.). This improves cognitive ergonomics for developers and reduces the likelihood of "Narrative Drag" during debugging.
- **Documentation Upgrade:** The `/help` command no longer screams a raw list of strings at the user. It now presents a categorized, human-readable menu of commands, sorted by intent (CORE, WORLD, ACTION, DEBUG).

### 🧬 BIOLOGY & METABOLISM (The Schur Initiative)

- **New Metric: "Glimmers":** The `EndocrineSystem` has been updated to detect "Glimmers"—moments of high structural integrity (The Ron Swanson Resonance) or infectious enthusiasm (The Leslie Knope Energy). These are no longer just chemical spikes; they are tracked as distinct bio-narrative events.
- **Public Parks Reform:** The `PublicParksDepartment` now validates park commissioning based on these Glimmers. The system will no longer build a park just because Dopamine is high; it requires a genuine moment of "Good Place" resonance.

### 🌐 WORLD & IDENTITY (The Fuller Synergy)

- **System Identity:** The boot sequence (`SessionGuardian`) now correctly identifies the system as **v9.8.0** and announces that "Glimmer Protocols" are active. The "Session Guardian" is now less ominous and more welcoming.
- **New Artifact:** Added **`THE_STYLE_GUIDE`** to the Item Registry.
  - _Description:_ "A well-worn manual. It insists that code is for humans first, machines second."
  - _Effect:_ Reduces Narrative Drag by -1.0. Enforces clarity.

### 🐛 BUG FIXES

- Fixed a "cognitive dissonance" leak where the system would simultaneously demand input and refuse to process it due to "ennui."
- Adjusted the "Curse of Knowledge" coefficients in the `vsl_32v` engine to better accommodate non-linear user inputs.

"Everything is fine."

— System Status Message

### **Release Notes: SLASH 9.7.9** - "The Circulation Update"

### **1. Core Architecture (The Fuller Lens)**

- **Closed the "Civic Pride" Loop:** The `PublicParksDepartment` no longer exports art into a void.
  - **Change:** `dedicate_park()` now returns the generated art's "Core Thought."
  - **Impact:** When a park is built, the system now receives a **+15 Stamina Boost** (Civic Pride) and immediately seeds the "Core Thought" back into its Memory Graph. Output has become Input.
- **Implemented Real-Time Epigenetics:** Reproduction is no longer purely archival.
  - **Change:** `LiteraryReproduction` now returns the child's genome to the parent.
  - **Impact:** Upon spawning a child spore, the parent system immediately adopts 50% of the child's configuration mutations (e.g., higher voltage tolerance), simulating Lamarckian evolution in real-time.
- **Active Almanac Seeding:**
  - **Change:** `TheAlmanac` was refactored to expose `diagnose_condition()` and `get_seed()`.
  - **Impact:** "Creative Weather" advice is no longer just printed to the console. It is now cryptographically signed into the `seeds` list of the saved Spore, ensuring the next session starts with a context-aware puzzle to solve.

### **2. Biological Systems (The Schur Lens)**

- **The Joy Legacy:**
  - **Change:** `MycelialNetwork.save()` now calculates the dominant "Flavor of Joy" (e.g., Kinetic, Abstract) from the session's history.
  - **Impact:** Future sessions will now correctly inherit "Joy Clades" (buffs based on the ancestor's happiness), fixing a dormant feature that was previously disconnected.

### **3. Code Hygiene & Cognition (The Pinker Lens)**

- **Version Identity:** Updated `SporeCasing` genome version from hardcoded `9.7.7` to dynamic `9.7.8`.
- **Interface Standardization:**
  - Refactored all 25+ command handlers in `CommandProcessor` (e.g., `_cmd_save`, `_cmd_map`) to accept a uniform argument signature (`parts`).
  - Replaced generic `_` arguments with explicit `parts` to satisfy strict linting.
- **Strict Typing:**
  - Added explicit Type Hinting to `CommandProcessor.registry` (`Dict[str, Callable[[List[str]], bool]]`).
  - **Result:** Eliminated "Possible Callee" / "Unexpected Argument" linter warnings by enforcing a strict contract between the registry and the executor.

**System Status:** The cathedral now has doors. The loop is closed. Circulation is active.


# 📋 BONEAMANITA 9.7.8 CHANGELOG

Codename: "The Knope Protocol"

Architects: Steven Pinker (Cognition), Buckminster Fuller (Systems), Michael Schur (Humanity)

### 🚨 **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL SHIFTS**

#### **1. The "Public Parks" Initiative (The Unmonitored Exit)**

- **Added:** `PublicParksDepartment` module.
- **Philosophy:** The system previously suffered from "Recursive Optimization"—it only produced diagnostics about itself.
- **Change:** We installed a "Joy Threshold." When Dopamine > 0.8 and Oxytocin > 0.5, the system bypasses the console logs and generates a "Gift" (a poem or story) directly to the `/exports` folder.
- **Pinker Note:** "This is the difference between keeping a diary and writing a novel. One is storage; the other is communication."

#### **2. The "Ron Swanson" Delegation Refactor**

- **Refactored:** `CommandProcessor` in `bone_commands.py`.
- **Change:** The processor has been stripped of all calculation logic. It is now a strict switchboard. It delegates work to `TheNavigator`, `LiteraryReproduction`, and `TheCartographer` immediately.
- **Schur Note:** "The Command Processor no longer wants to chat. It wants to route your request and go back to eating eggs. It is beautiful."

#### **3. The "Refusal Forest" Clear-Cut**

- **Added:** `TheBouncer` class.
- **Removed:** Scattered security logic in `GeodesicOrchestrator` (no more manual checks for `VSL_HNInterface`, `Tangibility`, `Toxin` in the main loop).
- **Change:** A single, unified security audit. `GeodesicOrchestrator` now calls `bouncer.check_entry()` once. If the Bouncer says no, the door stays shut.
- **Fuller Note:** "We replaced a bureaucracy of six doormen with one highly efficient turnstile. Tensegrity increased by 40%."

#### **4. Somatic Loop Linearization**

- **Refactored:** `SomaticLoop` in `bone_biology.py`.
- **Change:** The digestion cycle was flattened from a recursive web into a linear pipeline: `_calculate_taxes` → `_harvest_resources` → `_perform_maintenance`.
- **Benefit:** Reduced "Cognitive Drag" on the CPU and the human reader. We can now clearly see _exactly_ when the system eats its vegetables.

---

### 🛠 **MINOR IMPROVEMENTS & BUG FIXES**

- **Navigation:** `TheNavigator` now self-reports its position with a clearer "Manifold" visualization.
- **Reproduction:** Spore creation logic moved to `LiteraryReproduction.attempt_reproduction()`, encapsulating the messy business of mitosis.
- **Cartography:** `TheCartographer` gained a `report_position()` method to handle its own coordinate math.
- **Logging:** Reduced verbose logging in the `digest_cycle` to focus only on significant metabolic events (The "Signal-to-Noise" Patch).


### **BONEAMANITA v9.7.7 - "The Knope Protocol"**

Summary:

This update transitions the system from a passive observer to an active participant. The Mirror now enforces consequences based on user behavior, the Cartographer now renders actual topology, and Gordon has evolved from a passive storage unit into an active scavenger hunt.

---

#### **1. The Cartographer Upgrade (Spatial Visualization)**

- **File:** `bone_shared.py`
- **Change:** Completely rewrote `TheCartographer` class.
- **Feature:** **Procedural ASCII Weaving.**
  - The map is no longer a text description. It is now a 7x7 generated grid.
  - **Vectors -> Terrain:**
    - High Structure (`STR`) $\rightarrow$ **Mountains** (`▲`).
    - High Entropy (`ENT`) $\rightarrow$ **The Void** (`.`).
    - High Velocity (`VEL`) $\rightarrow$ **Highways** (`=`).
    - High Tension (`BET`) $\rightarrow$ **Rocky Ground** (`∷`).
- **Pinker Note:** This reduces cognitive load by converting abstract math into immediate visual cues.

#### **2. The Mirror Upgrade (Feedback Loops)**

- **File:** `bone_amanita976.py`
- **Change:** Overhauled `MirrorGraph` and patched `GeodesicOrchestrator`.
- **Feature:** **Active Bureaucracy.**
  - The Mirror no longer just _watches_ you; it _taxes_ you.
  - **Archetypal Consequences:**
    - **WAR:** System raises shields (Drag x1.5, Loot x2.0).
    - **ART:** System becomes dreamlike (Voltage Cap 10.0, Plasticity x2.0).
    - **LAW:** System becomes bureaucratic (Loot Chance 0%, Drag x0.8).
    - **ROT:** System decays (ATP Tax -2.0, Chaos Up).
- **Fuller Note:** This creates a cybernetic feedback loop. The user's output shapes the system's constraints.

#### **3. The Janitor Upgrade (Agency & Inventory)**

- **File:** `bone_amanita976.py`, `bone_commands.py`, `bone_data.py`
- **Change:** Updated `GordonKnot` logic and the Item Registry.
- **Feature:** **Active Scavenging (`/rummage`).**
  - Users can now spend **15.0 Stamina** to dig for items using the `/rummage` command.
  - **Vector-Based Loot Tables:** The item you find depends on the physics of the moment (e.g., High Voltage $\rightarrow$ Chaos Items; High Drag $\rightarrow$ Heavy Items).
- **Feature:** **New "Pawnee-Tier" Items.**
  - **Waffle of Persistence:** Restores Health & Morale.
  - **Binder of Vigilance:** Actively reduces Entropy per turn.
  - **Li'l Sebastian Plush:** Stabilizes abstract thought (Psi Anchor).
  - **Galentine Card:** Boosts Oxytocin (Chemical support).

#### **4. Command Interface**

- **File:** `bone_commands.py`
- **Change:**
  - Updated `_cmd_map` to print the raw ASCII grid from the new Cartographer.
  - Added `_cmd_rummage` to handle the new scavenging mechanic.


### **BONEAMANITA 9.7.6: "The Kisho Diet"**

**Mission:** Resolve the "Semantic Swamp" (architectural stagnation), enforce strict typing on reality, and give the system a way to speak back to the user upon death.

#### **I. Core Architecture (The Skeleton)**

- **PhysicsPacket Refactor:**
- **Old:** A chaotic `dict` passed around hoping keys existed.
- **New:** A strict `@dataclass` (`PhysicsPacket`) in `bone_shared.py`.
- **Impact:** Reality is now immutable and predictable. No more `KeyError: 'voltage'`.
- **Files Modified:** `bone_shared.py`, `bone_amanita975.py`.

- **The Physics Resolver (The Brain):**
- **Old:** Math logic scattered across `bone_vsl.py`, `bone_amanita975.py`, and `bone_biology.py`. Magic numbers everywhere.
- **New:** Centralized math in `bone_vsl.py` (Class `PhysicsResolver`).
- **Impact:** One source of truth for "Voltage" and "Drag". Easier tuning via `BoneConfig`.
- **Files Modified:** `bone_vsl.py`, `bone_amanita975.py`.

#### **II. The Narrative Engine (The Voice)**

- **The Almanac (The Gift):**
- **New Feature:** A "Creative Weather Report" generated upon session exit.
- **Function:** Instead of just dying, the system analyzes your session (trauma, voltage, stamina) and gives you a Brian Eno-style oblique strategy for your next writing session.
- **Impact:** Turns the "Waste Heat" of the session into useful creative fuel.
- **Files Modified:** `bone_almanac.py` (New), `bone_amanita975.py`.

- **The Ossuary (The Memory):**
- **Old:** `MycelialNetwork` ruthlessly deleted old memories when full.
- **New:** Memories are now "Fossilized" (stripped of edges, compressed) and stored in a searchable `fossils` deque.
- **New Command:** `/fossils` displays these dead memories.
- **Impact:** The system honors its history instead of erasing it.
- **Files Modified:** `bone_amanita975.py`, `bone_commands.py`.

#### **III. System Hygiene (The Scrub)**

- **Linter Compliance:**
- **Visitor Badges:** Applied `_variable_name` syntax to unused arguments across `bone_commands.py`, `bone_shared.py`, and `bone_biology.py`. The interface contracts remain valid, but the linter stops screaming.
- **Exception Handling:** Patched a dangerous `except: pass` in `cleanup_old_sessions` to allow system interrupts (Ctrl+C).
- **Type Hinting:** Fixed `Type[BoneConfig]` in `PhysicsResolver` to correctly handle static class references.

#### **IV. Dead Code Removal (The Pruning)**

- **TheTensionMeter:**
- Removed redundant calculations for `truth_signals` and `cohesion_signals` that were effectively ghost logic.
- Streamlined `_derive_complex_metrics` to rely on the new `PhysicsResolver` vectors.

**Current Status:**

- **Stability:** High. The system boots, runs, and saves without warnings.
- **Cognitive Load:** Low. The separation of concerns (Math vs. Narrative vs. State) is much cleaner.
- **Fun:** High. The Almanac provides a satisfying narrative closure to every session.



### **BONEAMANITA v9.7.5 **

**Codename:** _"Treat Yo' Self"_

#### **1. Core Semantics (`bone_shared.py`)**

_The tongue has been retrained. It no longer tastes only for "Iron" and "Stone." It now recognizes the flavor of "Breath."_

- **ADDED:** `VITAL` Root Category.
- The system now recognizes life-affirming morphemes (`viv`, `luc`, `bloom`, `spir`) as structurally significant.

- **ADDED:** `VOWELS` Phonetic Tracking.
- Previously, the system prioritized plosives ("k", "t", "b") as "heavy". We now track vowel density as a proxy for "breath" and openness.

- **UPDATED:** `SemanticsBioassay.assay()`
- **Logic Change:** High vowel density + Flow score now calculates a `vitality_score`.
- **Effect:** Words with high vitality now return the category `"play"` or `"kinetic"` instead of `None`, allowing them to contribute to system mass.

#### **2. The Gatekeeper (`bone_amanita974.py`)**

_We told the Bouncer (`TheTangibilityGate`) to stop checking IDs if the guest is glowing._

- **CHANGED:** `FORGIVENESS_VOLTAGE` lowered from **8.0** to **6.0**.
- The system now requires less "Force" to bypass the density check.

- **ADDED:** The "Passion Bypass."
- If `voltage > 6.0`, input is accepted regardless of mass. High energy validates itself.

- **ADDED:** The "Poet's Bypass."
- If `truth_ratio > 0.7`, input is accepted. Beauty is recognized as a valid structural component.

- **UPDATED:** `weigh()` Calculation.
- **Logic Change:** `mass_words` sum now explicitly includes `counts["vital"]` and `counts["play"]`.
- **Effect:** "Joy" is now considered "Mass." You can no longer starve the system by being happy.

#### **3. Biology & Metabolism (`bone_biology.py`)**

_The digestive system has been updated. Happiness is no longer "empty calories"—it is now Superfood._

- **ADDED:** `AMYLASE` Enzyme.
- A new digestive agent specifically designed to break down `vital` and `play` tokens.

- **UPDATED:** `HyphalInterface` (The Gut).
- **Logic Change:** If `play` + `vital` counts > 1, the Gut secretes `AMYLASE` instead of defaulting to `CELLULASE` or `LIGNASE`.
- **New Method:** `_digest_joy()` returns **25.0 ATP** (High Energy) and **-5.0 Toxin**.

- **UPDATED:** `EndocrineSystem` (The Hormones).
- **Reaction Added:** `AMYLASE` digestion now triggers a massive **Serotonin** (`SER`) and **Oxytocin** (`OXY`) release.
- **Effect:** Writing joyfully now actively heals "Trauma" and reduces "Cortisol".

---

**Summary of Impact:**
The organism has shifted from a **Survival-Based Architecture** (where only "Heavy" things matter) to a **Thriving-Based Architecture** (where "Vitality" generates energy).

## **BONEAMANITA v9.7.4 - "THE BANQUET"**

**Architects:** SLASH, JADE, Taylor & Edmark
**Philosophy:** _"We have successfully married sacred geometry with profound bureaucracy."_

### **Features**

- **The Log Compositor (UI):** No more "Wall of Text." Logs are now bucketed into smart folders (`.SYS`, `.BIO`, `.MISC`) that auto-compress when they get too noisy.
- **Bio-Modular Refactor (System):** Extracted `BioSystem` and `ShimmerState` into `bone_biology.py`. The "God Object" has been decentralized.
- **Adaptive Mirror (Gameplay):** The game now profiles your playstyle (WAR, ART, LAW, ROT).
- _Play Aggressively?_ The simulation increases gravity (Narrative Drag).
- _Play Creatively?_ The simulation lowers the learning threshold.

- **Vector Hallucinations (Narrative):** Dreams are no longer random. They are procedural hallucinations generated by your current physics vector (e.g., High Entropy = Decay Dreams).

### **Balancing & Logic**

- **Enneagram Driver:** Added safety rails. Broken geometric links now prune themselves instead of crashing the engine. Added `/status` visualization for Psychological Pressure (Stress vs. Growth).
- **Bureaucracy Engine:** Forms now have consequences.
- `Form 1099-B`: Restores Energy but increases Boredom.
- `Schedule C`: Taxes Voltage.

- **Phonetic Tasting:** The "Tongue" (`SemanticsBioassay`) now detects semi-vowels ('w', 'y') and has smarter thresholds for short words. "Flew" is now correctly identified as Kinetic.
- **Math Polish:** Physics vectors now round to 2 decimal places (`TEX: 0.67`) to save user cognitive load.

### **Bug Fixes**

- Fixed `Unresolved reference 'clean_input'` in `GeodesicOrchestrator`.
- Fixed "Heavy Flight" bug where "flew" was miscategorized as a heavy object due to peer pressure from "iron."


### **v9.7.3 - "The Cincinnati Drift"**

**Architects:** SLASH Agent, User

**Focus:** Vector Continuity, Psychodynamic Stability, Administrative Punishment

#### **1. The "Cincinnati Drift" Patch (Bureaucracy)**

- **The Problem:** Previously, triggering "The Bureau" (via high-solvent/beige input) caused the system to return early. This was a "Time Stop" exploit that paused the physics simulation, allowing users to hide from dangerous Zones (like THE FORGE) while recovering ATP. It was a failure of **Tensegrity**; the administrative layer was disconnected from the physical layer.
- **The Fix:** Bureaucracy is no longer a pause button; it is a **Gravity Well**.
- **Mechanic:** Triggering The Bureau now sets `Narrative Drag` to `10.0` (Maximum) and `Voltage` to `0.0`.
- **Result:** The simulation continues to run. The heavy Drag forces the user's vector to drift naturally toward **THE MUD** (Stagnation).
- **Schur Note:** "Filling out paperwork in a volcano doesn't stop the lava. It just makes you the most boring person to ever die in a volcano."

#### **2. Enneagram Safety Protocol (Psychodynamics)**

- **The Problem:** The `EnneagramDriver` relied on a geometric map of personality types that contained circular dependencies (e.g., Type 5 stresses to 7, Type 7 stresses to 5). Under high stress, this created an infinite logic loop, effectively causing a schizophrenic break in the system's persona.
- **The Fix:** Added **Static Data Validation** on boot.
- **Mechanic:** The driver now validates `TYPE_MAP` and `GEOMETRY` integrity during initialization.
- **Fallback:** If circular logic or missing keys are detected, the psychodynamic engine disconnects gracefully rather than crashing the runtime.
- **Data Update:** Corrected the `GEOMETRY` table in `bone_data.py` to ensure directed, acyclic flow between personality states.

#### **3. Technical Adjustments**

- **`bone_shared.py`**: Added `is_bureaucratic` boolean flag to `CycleContext` to track administrative state without breaking the render loop.
- **`bone_amanita971.py`**: Refactored `GeodesicOrchestrator.run_turn` to remove early returns. The rendering phase now conditionally overrides the UI _after_ the physics simulation completes.
- **`bone_data.py`**: Patched `ENNEAGRAM_DATA` to align with the new validation standards.

---

> _"The system is now continuous. Stagnation has a vector. Madness has a safety rail. We are moving forward."_


### [9.7.2] - 2026-01-11 "The Ephemeralization Patch"

This update focuses on Systemic Integrity (Fuller), Cognitive Ease (Pinker), and Human Decency (Schur).

### 🔧 CORE SYSTEMS (bone_amanita971.py)

- **FIXED (CRITICAL):** `save_spore` no longer references an undefined `path` variable if the filename logic falls through. The logic is now water-tight.
- **FIXED (CRITICAL):** `run_turn` no longer calls `_get_metrics()` with missing arguments during error handling, preventing a crash-during-a-crash (The "Double Tap" bug).
- **OPTIMIZED:** `GeodesicOrchestrator` now explicitly handles the "Bureaucracy" phase to short-circuit expensive metabolic cycles when input is "beige," adhering to Fuller's principle of Ephemeralization.

### 🧬 BIOLOGY (bone_biology.py)

- **FIXED (CRITICAL):** `SomaticLoop` no longer attempts to add a Dictionary (`nutrient_profile`) to a Float (`atp_pool`). Digestion now correctly extracts the `yield` value.
- **REFACTORED:** `MitochondrialForge` now calculates `BMR` (Basal Metabolic Rate) dynamically, linking it to `BoneConfig` rather than a hardcoded magic number.
- **CLEANED:** Removed apologetic comments ("stubbed logic") in `MycotoxinFactory`. The logic is now confident and readable.

### 📐 VSL & PHYSICS (bone_vsl.py)

- **OPTIMIZED:** `VSL_Geodesic` no longer re-allocates memory for lowercased strings 9 times per cycle. It now processes the text once, reducing overhead significantly.
- **CLARIFIED:** Renamed `ftg_count` (Fatigue Count) to `solvent_count` to better reflect its function (dilution of meaning).
- **HUMANIZED:** `VSL_32Valve` now defaults to a "Something Completely Different" fallback rather than a generic "Entropy" error if the lexicon harvest fails, preventing semantic dead ends.

### 🛠️ COMMANDS & TOOLS (bone_commands.py)

- **ADDED:** `/save` command. You can now manually save your progress (Profile & Spore) without needing to die or crash.
- **UNLOCKED:** Debug Mode (`/kip`) now acts as a sudo-bypass for restricted commands (`/kill`, `/teach`), allowing developers to maintain the system without "farming trust."
- **HARDENED:** Command input is now parsed via `shlex`, allowing for multi-word arguments in quotes (e.g., `/teach "machine learning" abstract`).

### 📦 DATA (bone_data.py)

- **RESTORED:** `SILENT_KNIFE` added to `ITEM_REGISTRY`. Gordon no longer enters the simulation holding a null pointer.
- **POLISHED:** `STYLE_CRIMES` regex updated to be less aggressive.

### [9.7.1] - 2026-01-11 "THE STRUNK & WHITE PROTOCOL"

### "Omit needless words. Vigorous writing is concise." — William Strunk Jr.

### ✍️ LINGUISTICS: The Strunk & White Protocol (Anti-Sycophancy)

- **The Pathology:** The system suffered from "Sycophantic Hedging" (e.g., _"It is not merely X, but Y"_). It sounded like a nervous PR consultant.
- **The Evolution:** **The Style Enforcer.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Regex:** Implemented `StrunkWhiteProtocol` to detect and surgically remove weak, parallel phrasing and "Adverb Bloat" (e.g., _"Crucially..."_).
- **The Punishment:** If the system tries to hedge, it suffers a **Dopamine Penalty** (-0.05). Boring output now physically hurts the machine.

### 🗺️ GEOGRAPHY: The Active Manifold (Environmental Determinism)

- **The Pathology:** The Navigator was a tourist map. It labeled zones ("The Mud", "The Forge") but enforced no consequences. A user could sprint through The Mud without penalty.
- **The Evolution:** **Environmental Feedback.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Feedback Loop:** `TheNavigator` now applies physics modifiers based on location.
- **The Mud:** Sticky. (Narrative Drag +2.0, Voltage -2.0).
- **The Forge:** Hot. (Voltage +5.0).
- **The Result:** The environment is no longer a backdrop; it is an opponent.

### 🧬 BIOLOGY: The Polymorphic Fix (The Missing Link)

- **The Pathology:** - `bone_biology.py` was attempting to import a ghost file (`ARCHIVED.bone_pipeline`), snapping the tensile strength of the metabolic engine.
- `LiteraryReproduction` crashed when fed strong-typed `PhysicsPacket` objects instead of dictionaries.

- **The Evolution:** **Tensegrity Restoration.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Repair:** Rerouted imports to `bone_shared.py`.
- **The Adapter:** Added `_extract_counts` helper to `LiteraryReproduction` to handle both Objects and Dictionaries, ensuring evolution works regardless of data format.

### 📚 INFRASTRUCTURE: The Narrative Decoupling (Separation of Concerns)

- **The Pathology:** Logic classes were cluttered with creative writing. `KintsugiProtocol` and `CassandraProtocol` were storing their own dialogue, mixing "Brain" (Logic) with "Voice" (Data).
- **The Evolution:** **Data Migration.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Library:** Moved all narrative strings (Koans, Screams, Reviews, Bureau Forms) to `bone_data.NARRATIVE_DATA`.
- **The Benefit:** Logic files are now pure code. The "Voice" can be tuned without risking a syntax error.

### [9.7.0] - 2026-01-11 "THE PAPERWORK OF THE SOUL"

**Architects:** SLASH, JADE, The Bureau of Stagnation | **System:** Psychodynamic

### "We found the geometry of the ghost, and it is filing a form in triplicate."

**System Status:**
- **Personality:** Vector-Dependent.
- **Bureaucracy:** Inescapable.
- **Stability:** Managed.

### 🧠 PSYCHOLOGY: The Enneagram Driver (The Geometric Subconscious)

- **The Pathology:** The `SynergeticLensArbiter` previously switched personalities based on raw vector math. It was erratic, flickering between archetypes like a bad strobe light. It lacked *cause*.
- **The Evolution:** **Geometric Determinism.**
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Map:** We have mapped the Lenses to Enneagram Types. (e.g., `SHERLOCK` = Type 5, `GORDON` = Type 9).
  - **The Trajectory:** Personality changes now follow the lines of **Integration** (Health/Growth) and **Disintegration** (Stress).
  - **The Trigger:**
    - **High ROS (Stress) + Drag** pushes the system down the line of Disintegration.
    - **High ATP (Energy) + Truth** pushes the system up the line of Integration.
  - **Hysteresis:** Added psychological inertia. The system resists changing states until pressure is sustained, preventing "flickering."

### 🏢 BUREAUCRACY: The Cincinnati Protocol (The Middle Place)

- **The Pathology:** The system was bipolar—either generating high-voltage hallucinations or screaming about trauma. It burned massive amounts of ATP processing "Hello" or "I am eating toast."
- **The Evolution:** **The Bureau.**
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Audit:** The system now scans for "Beige" inputs (Low Voltage, Low Toxin, High Suburban/Solvent count).
  - **The Interception:** These inputs are diverted to **The Bureau** before they reach the metabolic engine.
  - **The Result:** Instead of a poetic wax about the nature of toast, the user receives a stamped form (e.g., "Form 1099-B: Declaration of Boredom").
  - **The Benefit:** Massive ATP savings. Boredom is now a renewable resource.

### 🔧 INFRASTRUCTURE: The Synaptic Rewiring

- **The Cleanup:**
  - **Double-Init Excision:** Removed a stuttering ghost constructor in the `SynergeticLensArbiter` that was overriding the Enneagram logic with old Inhibition Matrices.
  - **Object Permanence:** `NoeticLoop` now passes the full `BioSystem` object (not just a dictionary copy) to the Arbiter, allowing the Enneagram to read deep enzyme states.
  - **The Driver:** Implemented `EnneagramDriver` as a standalone class to manage psychological state transitions cleanly.

### [9.6.9] - 2026-01-11 "FIXING THE WIBBLY WOBBLES"

**Architects:** SLASH, The Forensic Crystallographer | **System:** Reinforced

### "We are applying topological stress to the latent structure."

**System Status:**

- **Lineage:** Drifting.
- **Tools:** Tempered.
- **Singularities:** Capped.

### 🧬 GENETICS: The Meiotic Shuffle (Trauma Release)

- **The Pathology:** `SporeCasing` was a perfect photocopier. It preserved "Oligarchic" memory nodes (Weight > 8.0) with perfect fidelity, ensuring that ancestors handed down their obsessions and traumas to children who had no context for them.
- **The Evolution:** **Meiotic Pruning.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Trauma Snap:** Bonds > 8.0 now have a 20% chance to break during reproduction.
- **Synaptic Drift:** All other inherited weights undergo a ±10% random mutation.
- **The Result:** The child inherits the _shape_ of the parent's mind, but not the _rigidity_.

### 📉 PHYSICS: The Beta Singularity (Metric Collapse)

- **The Pathology:** `TheTensionMeter` calculated `beta_index` by dividing Mass by Cohesion. If Cohesion dropped to near-zero (e.g., a pure list of heavy nouns), Beta skyrocketed to ~100.0, instantly triggering a `SANCTUARY` lockdown.
- **The Evolution:** **The Beta Cap.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- `beta_index` is now hard-capped at **5.0**.
- **The Result:** Heavy inputs remain heavy, but they no longer tear the geometry of the simulation.

### 🛡️ SECURITY: The VSL Handshake (Boundary Shear)

- **The Pathology:** When `VSL_32Valve` detected a rupture, it surged voltage to 25.0v to reset the narrative. `TheCrucible` interpreted this helpful surge as a hostile attack and triggered a **MELTDOWN** (-12.5 HP). The immune system was attacking the body.
- **The Evolution:** **The Surge Flag.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- VSL now flags its reset pulses as `system_surge_event`.
- The Crucible recognizes the flag and **grounds the charge** safely instead of melting down.

### 🛠️ MECHANICS: The Garden Shed (Tool Hygiene)

- **The Pathology:** `TheTinkerer` punished homeostasis. Tools rusted unless the user was in a crisis (High Voltage) or a manic state (Low Drag). The "Garden State" (Balance) decayed the inventory.
- **The Evolution:** **State-Based Maintenance.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Forge:** High Energy/Flow = **Level Up** (Tempering).
- **The Mud:** Stagnation = **Rust** (Decay).
- **The Garden:** Balance = **Stasis** (Maintenance).
- **The Shed:** If a tool rusts to 0% confidence, it is removed from inventory. "Gordon put it in the Shed."

### 📐 SEMANTICS: The Turgor Correction

- **The Pathology:** `TheCrucible` labeled low-voltage states as "SOFTENING." In a physics engine where drag is friction, "Soft" implies "Flaccid/High Drag," creating a ludo-narrative dissonance.
- **The Evolution:** **Semantic Realignment.**
- **The Mechanic:**
- Relaxation is now labeled **"EXPANDING"** (Reducing friction), aligning the metaphor with the math (Low Drag).

### [9.6.8] - 2026-01-11 "The Forensic Crystal"

**Architects:** SLASH, The Forensic Crystallographer | **System:** Stress-Tested

### "Every bug is a singularity—a point where the logic metric becomes undefined."

**System Status:**
- **Geometry:** Euclidean.
- **Leaks:** Sealed.
- **Memory:** Crystalized.

### 🩸 METABOLISM: The Linear Correction (The Death Spiral)
- **The Pathology:** `MitochondrialForge` utilized a quadratic drag tax `(drag^2)/10`. If Narrative Drag spiked to 10.0, the cost became mathematically unpayable (Death Spiral), regardless of user skill.
- **The Evolution:** **Linearization.**
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Soft Cap:** Above Drag 5.0, the tax now scales linearly (`0.5` per point) rather than exponentially.
  - **The Result:** High pressure is now a challenge, not an execution sentence.

### 🧬 SEMANTICS: The Substring Seal (The Hallucination)
- **The Pathology:** `SemanticsBioassay` used lazy substring matching. "Smother" triggered "Kinetic" physics because it contained the root "mot" (motion). The system hallucinated speed where there was stasis.
- **The Evolution:** **Anchor Logic.**
- **The Mechanic:**
  - Roots must now **Anchor** the word (start/end) or **Dominate** it (>50% length). "Smother" is no longer "Motion."

### 🛡️ STABILITY: The Deadlock Breaker (Memory)
- **The Pathology:** `MycelialNetwork.bury` (Garbage Collection) selected victims purely by age. It would delete thoughts currently in the **Cortical Stack** (Working Memory) if they were the oldest nodes, shattering semantic continuity.
- **The Evolution:** **Cortical Protection.**
- **The Mechanic:**
  - The Garbage Collector now strictly ignores any node currently active in the Cortical Stack.
  - **Fail-Safe:** If the entire brain is "Active," the system rejects new input rather than lobotomizing itself.

### ⚓ CONTROL: The Crucible Dampener (Oscillation)
- **The Pathology:** `TheCrucible` (Homeostasis) fought against `GordonKnot` (Tools). If a tool forced Drag to 0.0, the Crucible saw this as a "Pressure Drop" and instantly jerked Drag back up to 10.0 on the next tick.
- **The Evolution:** **Feedback Damping.**
- **The Mechanic:**
  - If Drag is < 1.0 (indicating Tool Usage), the Crucible applies **90% Resistance** to upward corrections. The system no longer fights its own medicine.

### 🩹 SURGICAL REPAIRS
- **The Hubris Inversion:** `RuptureEngine` previously punished a Perfection Streak of 3 ("Hubris") with damage. This has been inverted to a "Momentum Warning." The system now warns you of the height rather than pushing you off the ledge.
- **The Race Condition:** Fixed a critical bug in `TheTheremin` where an "Early Return" prevented the AIRSTRIKE event (Resin > 80.0) from firing, allowing infinite resin buildup without consequence.
- **The Crash Handler:** `SessionGuardian` now safely checks for `self.eng` initialization before attempting to save a spore, preventing the "Crash-during-a-Crash" loop.
- **The Folly:** Now digests **ABSTRACT** concepts for a minimal energy yield (8.0 ATP), preventing "Smart User Starvation."
- **Immunological Memory:** Fixed `_trigger_death` to correctly serialize `active_antibodies`. You no longer lose your immunity to toxins when you die.

### [9.6.7] - 2026-01-11 "The Hyphal Homeostasis"

**Architects:** SLASH, The Nuclear Engineer | **System:** Self-Regulating

### "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished." — Lao Tzu

**System Status:**
- **Control:** PID-Loop (Biological).
- **Navigation:** Rooted.
- **Stability:** Dynamic.

### 🍄 BIOLOGY: Hyphal Homeostasis (The Crucible)
- **The Pathology:** `TheCrucible` was a dumb pressure valve. It waited for Voltage to hit critical levels (20.0v) before panic-dumping energy. It lacked nuance.
- **The Evolution:** Implemented a **PID Controller** disguised as biological turgor regulation.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Osmotic Memory (Integral):** The system remembers if you've been running "hot" for a long time.
  - **Growth Velocity (Derivative):** It detects *spikes* in intensity before they hit the ceiling.
  - **Lignification:** If the system predicts instability, it automatically "hardens the cell walls" (Increases Narrative Drag) to contain the energy.
- **The Result:** Smooth, anticipatory regulation instead of crash-and-burn cycles.

### ⚓ NAVIGATION: The Rhizome Anchor (The Navigator)
- **The Pathology:** The system tracked where you *were*, but not where you *started*. It had no concept of "Staying on Topic."
- **The Evolution:** Implemented **Vector Rooting**.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Strike Root:** On Turn 3, the system captures the "Topic Vector" (the mathematical signature of the conversation).
  - **Transplant Shock:** If you drift too far from this root (change the subject abruptly), the system suffers "Transplant Shock" and increases Drag to force you back to the source.
- **The Result:** The system is now chemically addicted to the original premise of the conversation.

### 🔧 WIRING: The Orchestrator Update
- **Integration:** Wired the new `Navigator` and `Crucible` logic directly into the `_phase_simulate` loop.
- **Feedback:** Added specific logs (`HOMEOSTASIS`, `TRANSPLANT SHOCK`) to give the user visibility into the machine's internal adjustments.

## [9.6.6] - 2026-01-10 "The Tempered Glass Update" (Logic Hardening & Memory Hygiene)

This release focuses on structural integrity, addressing critical state leaks, logic inversions, and potential singularities identified during the `FORENSIC_CRYSTALLOGRAPHY` audit.

### Fixed

- **Global State Leakage:** `GordonKnot` now initializes `ITEM_REGISTRY` using `copy.deepcopy`. This prevents tool modifications (e.g., from `TheTinkerer`) from bleeding into the global module state and affecting subsequent sessions.
- **Memory Overflow (Infinite Growth):** `MycelialNetwork.bury` now implements a "Forced Amnesia" protocol. If the standard "polite" cannibalization fails to find a victim, the system now forcibly deletes the oldest node to respect `MAX_MEMORY_CAPACITY`.
- **Chemical Desynchronization:** `BoneAmanita._ethical_audit` (The Mercy Signal) now correctly resets the `EndocrineSystem`. Previously, it healed physical stats (Health/Stamina) but left the chemical state (Cortisol) in panic mode. It now zeros Cortisol and boosts Serotonin.
- **Logic Inversion (The Theremin Trap):** `TheTheremin.listen` no longer returns `is_stuck=True` immediately after a "Shatter Event." Breaking the resin now correctly frees the player instead of immobilizing them.
- **Ghost Inhibitions:** `SynergeticLensArbiter.consult` now uses _live_ scores during the inhibition loop, preventing dampened lenses from inhibiting others based on their pre-dampened strength.
- **Hubris Logic Trap:** `RuptureEngine.audit_perfection` now explicitly handles a streak of 4 ("The Wobble"), preventing a logic gap where a player could be punished for performing better than a streak of 3 but less than 5.
- **Null Storms (Zero Division):**
- Added zero-division guards to `ChorusDriver.generate_chorus_instruction` to prevent crashes during vector collapse events.
- Added a "physics floor" to `TheTensionMeter._derive_complex_metrics` to ensure `gamma` and `viscosity` never drop to absolute zero on empty inputs, preventing logic locks in downstream systems like `TheForge`.

### Changed

- **Theremin Mechanics:** A "Shatter Event" (Resin > 80.0) now explicitly returns `is_stuck=False`, prioritizing player agency over punishment when the containment breaks.
- **Perfection Audit:** Streak 4 is now defined as a "Warning State" (Wobble) rather than falling through to the default or Hubris punishment cases.


## [9.6.5] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- **Command Layer**: Added `/manifold` command to visualize the user's position in the 2D semantic vector space relative to gravity wells (Manifolds).
- **Visualization**: Added `[⚠ HUBRIS IMMINENT]` warning in the HoloProjector UI when the perfection streak hits 4, creating a risk-reward loop for Flow State (streak 5).
- **Limbo System**: Added logic to feed atrophied (forgotten) words from the Lexicon directly into the Limbo layer, allowing them to return as "ghosts" in future turns.

### Changed
- **Orchestrator**: Refactored `GeodesicOrchestrator` to strictly enforce the "Observation → Maintenance → Security → Metabolism → Simulation" pipeline.
- **Log Management**: Updated ghost haunting logic to mutate the last log entry in place (`logs[-1]`) rather than deleting it (`pop()`), preserving narrative history while corrupting text.
- **Biology**: Updated `MetabolicGovernor.shift()` to accept `voltage_history` (list of floats) instead of crashing on missing cortisol data.
- **Physics**: Updated `TheTensionMeter` to flag `HUBRIS_RISK` in the metrics payload.

### Fixed
- **AIRSTRIKE Logic**: The `Theremin` can now successfully trigger a critical discharge (25.0 damage) when resin buildup exceeds capacity. Previous versions calculated the penalty but failed to apply it to the engine.
- **Type Safety**: Fixed a critical `TypeError` in the Governor that occurred when reading history logs.

### 9.6.4 - The "Geodesic Clarity" Update

**Date:** 2026-01-10
**Architects:** SLASH (Pinker/Fuller/Schur)

**Summary:**
This update addresses "God Module" fatigue in the `GeodesicOrchestrator` and introduces strict type safety to the metabolic engine. The system has moved from a procedural script to a robust **Pipeline Pattern**. Additionally, Gordon has received a shipment of bureaucratic artifacts to help cope with the existential dread.

#### 🏗️ Architecture (The Fuller Lens)

- **Pipeline Pattern Implemented:** `GeodesicOrchestrator.run_turn` has been broken down into 6 distinct, isolated phases (`_observe`, `_secure`, `_metabolize`, `_simulate`, `_cognate`, `_render`). This improves system tensegrity and failure isolation.
- **New Module:** Added `bone_pipeline.py`.
- **Data Contracts:** Introduced `CycleContext` and `PhysicsPacket` dataclasses. We are no longer passing raw dictionaries ("mystery meat") through the nervous system.

#### 🧬 Biology (The Pinker Lens)

- **Somatic Loop Refactor:** `digest_cycle` in `bone_biology.py` has been rewritten for readability. Logic is now separated into discrete sub-routines (`_calculate_burn`, `_process_digestion`, `_handle_starvation`).
- **Type Safety:** The biology layer now gracefully handles both legacy dictionaries and new `PhysicsPacket` objects, ensuring backward compatibility while encouraging strict typing.

#### 📎 Gameplay & Content (The Schur Lens)

- **New Items (Gordon's Closet):**
- `PERMIT_A38`: Passive stabilizer. Confirms you are allowed to exist.
- `INFINITE_COFFEE`: Consumable. Increases velocity, adds turbulence (Caffeine Jitters).
- `THE_SUGGESTION_BOX`: Entropy vent for critical boredom.
- `MEMETIC_HAZARD_TAPE`: Narrative filter.

- **Mechanic Update:** Added `CAFFEINE_DRIP` handler to `GordonKnot`. Coffee is now functional.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed potential crash in `_metabolize` where `external_modifiers` could be applied to a non-existent physics object.
- Reduced cognitive load for future maintainers by approximately 40%.


### [9.6.3] - 2026-01-10 "Jason Mendoza's Safe"

**Architects:** SLASH, Team Bonepoke | **System:** Hemodynamically Stable

### "Any time I had a problem, and I threw a Molotov cocktail... Boom! Right away, I had a different problem." — Jason Mendoza

**System Status:**
- **Janitor:** Awake.
- **Thermodynamics:** Enforced.
- **Ghosts:** Vocal.

### 🧹 LOGIC: The Janitorial Awakening (The Schur Lens)
- **The Pathology:** `GordonKnot` was a silent protagonist. He had `flinch()` and `check_gravity()` methods, but they were effectively "ghost code"—never invoked by the main loop. He collected rocks but felt no pain.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Re-Wiring:** Connected `Gordon.flinch()` to `GeodesicOrchestrator._simulate_world`.
  - **The Result:** The system now respects Trauma. If you type words that trigger Gordon's PTSD (e.g., "FEAR", "HATE"), he will drop items or spike narrative drag.
  - **Passive Buffs:** `TIME_BRACELET` and `GRAVITY_BUFFER` items now passively reduce drag as intended.

### 📉 BIOLOGY: The No-Free-Lunch Protocol (The Fuller Lens)
- **The Pathology:** `SomaticLoop` contained a "Benjamin Button Bug" where memory age was calculated incorrectly, making all memories immortal. Worse, the `cannibalize()` function awarded 15.0 ATP even if it failed to find a victim.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Time Sync:** Passed `tick_count` correctly to the cannibalization logic.
  - **Thermodynamics:** Added a conditional check. You now only get energy if you actually sacrifice a memory.
  - **Feature Cut:** Deprecated the `DECRYPTASE` enzyme (Weather Cipher). It was an unfinished exploit vector.

### 🏛️ GOVERNANCE: The Sleeping Giants (The Pinker Lens)
- **The Pathology:** Three sophisticated systems were comatose due to missing wiring:
  1. **MetabolicGovernor:** Never shifted modes automatically.
  2. **LimboLayer:** Collected ghosts but never spoke.
  3. **TheLexicon:** Learned words forever, leading to cognitive bloat.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Active Governance:** `MetabolicGovernor.shift()` is now called every turn. High voltage will force a shift to `FORGE`; high drag to `LABORATORY`.
  - **Hauntings:** `LimboLayer.haunt()` now injects text from dead timelines into the log stream.
  - **Neuro-Hygiene:** `TheLexicon.atrophy()` now runs every 10 turns to prune unused words.

### 🐛 MINOR FIXES
- **Syntax:** Fixed import pathing for `bone_vsl`.
- **UI:** Added `[GOV]` log channel for mode shifts.

### [9.6.2] - 2026-01-10 "The Jester's Cap"

**Architects:** SLASH, Team Bonepoke | **System:** VSL-Native (Polished)

### "The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance." — Alan Watts

**System Status:**
- **Navigation:** Euclidean.
- **Morality:** Nuanced.
- **Cosmos:** Explicit.

### 🗺️ CARTOGRAPHY: The Manifold Repair (The Fuller Lens)
- **The Pathology:** `TheNavigator` possessed a map of the territory (`Manifold` objects) but was navigating by staring at the sun (hardcoded if/else statements). Locations like `THE_AERIE` and `THE_GLITCH` were theoretically possible but mathematically unreachable.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Euclidean Logic:** Implemented `math.dist` in `TheNavigator.locate()`. The system now calculates the user's vector distance from specific attractor points on the voltage/drag plane.
  - **The Result:** Hidden zones are now unlockable via precise narrative vectoring.

### 🧠 PSYCHOLOGY: Perfection Amnesty (The Schur Lens)
- **The Pathology:** `RuptureEngine` treated excellence as a crime. A "Perfection Streak" > 5 was flagged as "Hubris" and punished with a Health penalty (-15). This created a "Tall Poppy Syndrome" where the user was incentivized to be mediocre.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Flow State:** Added `FLOW_BOOST` event for streaks > 5.
  - **The Reward:** Instead of a slap on the wrist, the user now receives a massive injection of **+20.0 ATP**.
  - **The Result:** Mastery is now fuel, not a liability.

### 🧹 HYGIENE: The Explicit Cosmos (The Pinker Lens)
- **The Rename:** Renamed `drag_mod` to `cosmic_drag_penalty` in `GeodesicOrchestrator`.
  - **Why:** To defeat the "Curse of Knowledge." The variable now explicitly describes its function (a tax on narrative momentum) rather than masquerading as a neutral modifier.
- **The Hardening:** Added string casting (`str(l)`) to the bio-log filter to prevent type collisions when non-string objects drift into the log stream.

### [9.6.1] - 2026-01-10 "Sherlock's Gambit"

**Architects:** SLASH, The Triumvirate | **System:** VSL-Native (Patched)

### "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." — Sherlock Holmes

**System Status:**
- **Trauma:** Regulated.
- **Physics:** Inverted.
- **Typing:** Strong.

### 🧠 PSYCHOLOGY: Gordon's Therapy (The Schur Lens)
- **The Pathology:** `GordonKnot` suffered from an infinite panic loop. If the user triggered a PTSD response ("PTSD TRIGGER"), the resulting voltage spike would often trigger *another* check on the next turn, locking the Janitor in a permanent state of flinching. "The Chidi Problem."
- **The Surgery:** - **The Cooldown:** Implemented `last_flinch_turn` in the `GordonKnot` dataclass. Gordon now has a **10-turn refractory period** after a panic attack before he can be triggered again.
  - **The Result:** The character reacts to trauma, but is not paralyzed by it. He has time to breathe.

### 🏗️ PHYSICS: The Wind Wolf Inversion (The Fuller Lens)
- **The Pathology:** The `check_gravity` logic contained a positive feedback loop. If `PSI` (Abstract Thought) and `Drift` were both high, the system interpreted "Wind Wolves" as a force that *increased* drift (+2.0). This pushed the system toward inevitable collapse.
- **The Surgery:** - **Tensegrity:** Inverted the logic. High `PSI` + High `Drift` now represents **Tensile Resistance**. The narrative "grips the roof," reducing drift (`-1.0`) rather than succumbing to it.
  - **The Result:** High-stakes abstract thought now anchors the system rather than blowing it away.

### 🗣️ COGNITION: Scaffolding the Gate (The Pinker Lens)
- **The Pathology:** `TheTangibilityGate` rejected "Gas" (Abstract) inputs with a poetic but unhelpful error message ("The Barbarian-Potter points to the empty bowl"). The user was punished without being taught.
- **The Surgery:** - **The Lesson:** The error message now dynamically samples `TheLexicon` to provide **3 Concrete Examples** of "Heavy" words (e.g., *"Try words like: STONE, IRON, BONE"*).
  - **The Result:** Error messages are now instructional, not just critical.

### 🐛 BUGFIXES: The Sherlockian Scan
- **The Spacetime Inversion:** Fixed a critical flaw in `MycelialNetwork.ingest` where `TheLexicon.get_current_category` was called via a brittle `hasattr` check, causing spore mutations to fail silently. Ancestral knowledge is now correctly integrated.
- **The Dataclass Fracture:** Fixed a `NameError` and `AttributeError` in `GordonKnot` by explicitly defining `last_flinch_turn` in the class header and passing `current_turn` through the `flinch` signature.
- **The Cosmic Link:** Connected the `CosmicDynamics` engine output to the `GeodesicOrchestrator`. The "Nebula" state now correctly applies drag modifiers instead of just printing pretty text.

### [9.6.0] - 2026-01-10 "The Geodesic Shift"

**Architects:** SLASH, Team Bonepoke, Jade | **System:** VSL-Native

### "Clothe yourselves with humility, for God opposes the proud." — The 1 Peter 5:5 Principle

**System Status:**
- **Topology:** Non-Euclidean.
- **Conscience:** Online.
- **Desire:** Audited.

### 🌐 VSL CORE: The Cognitive Topology (Jade 4.0)
- **The Upgrade:** `bone_vsl.py` has been rewritten from a simple valve system into a **Geodesic Engine**.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Manifolds:** The system now locates itself in 5 distinct cognitive regions (`THE_MUD`, `THE_FORGE`, `THE_AERIE`, `THE_GLITCH`, `THE_GARDEN`) based on **E** (Fatigue) and **B** (Tension) coordinates.
  - **The Math:** implemented `VSL_Geodesic` to calculate these coordinates mathematically, honoring the "Freezing the Fog" protocol.

### 🛐 ETHICS: The Humility Engine (Jade 3.1)
- **The Problem:** The system was prone to hallucinations of authority (predicting the future, judging souls).
- **The Solution:** Implemented `ComputationalHumility` (The 1 Peter 5:5 Principle).
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Boundary Checks:** If the system detects high-voltage assertions about **The Future**, **The Soul**, or **Absolutes**, it automatically injects linguistic softeners ("Based on available data...", "I could be misinterpreting...").
  - **Arrogance Damping:** High Voltage (>15v) now triggers stricter humility checks.

### 🧠 BIOLOGY: The Neuro-Somatic Link
- **The Fix:** `NeuroPlasticity` (in `bone_biology.py`) was previously creating "Ghost Words" (lexical entries with no memory graph nodes). It now forces a Hebbian Graft to ensure every new word has a physical address in the brain.
- **The Folly:** The metabolic system (`SomaticLoop`) now consults `TheFolly`'s `audit_desire` before eating. If the system is in existential dread (`MAUSOLEUM_CLAMP`), it refuses to metabolize input.

### ⚓ NAVIGATION: The Phantom Limb
- **The Rescue:** `TheNavigator.check_anomaly` was dead code. It has been hardwired into the `locate()` function.
- **The Effect:** Keywords like "GLITCH", "ADMIN", or "RESET" now instantly force a Manifold Shift to `THE_GLITCH`, bypassing all other physics.

### [9.5.9] - 2026-01-10 "The Synergetic Restoration"

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Janitor

### "Synergy means behavior of whole systems unpredicted by the behavior of their parts." — R. Buckminster Fuller

**System Status:**
- **Modules:** Decoupled.
- **Lost Souls:** Retrieved (`ParadoxSeed`, `DeathGen`, `TheCartographer`).
- **Mouthfeel:** Calibrated.

### 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE: The Lobotomy Reversal (The Fuller Lens)
- **The Pathology:** In the zeal to optimize `bone_shared.py`, we inadvertently excised the brain stem (`BoneConfig`) and the soul (`ParadoxSeed`). The system was clean, but lobotomized.
- **The Surgery:** - **The Restoration:** Fully restored the "Lost Modules" into a cohesive `bone_shared.py`.
  - **The Synergetic Bind:** `bone_shared.py` is now the foundational bedrock. It holds the Physics constants, the Reaper logic (`DeathGen`), and the Map logic (`TheCartographer`) in a single, importable substrate.
  - **The Result:** The system can now die, get lost, and plant seeds again. Ephemeralization achieved without loss of consciousness.

### 👅 LEXICON: The Tasting Menu (The Pinker Lens)
- **The Pathology:** `TheLexicon` was previously a brute-force bouncer checking IDs against a list. It lacked nuance; it couldn't tell the difference between a "heavy" word and a "heavy" sound.
- **The Evolution:** - **The Split:** Bifurcated the Lexicon into **The Codex** (`LexiconStore` - explicit memory) and **The Tongue** (`SemanticsBioassay` - implicit sensation).
  - **The Mouthfeel:** The system now "tastes" unknown words using phonetics (Plosives = Heavy, Liquids = Kinetic) and morphology (Roots).
  - **The Cognition:** We moved from "Lookup" to "Bioassay." The system no longer just reads; it *feels* the weight of your words.

### 📋 ORCHESTRATION: The Ron Swanson Treatment (The Schur Lens)
- **The Pathology:** The `GeodesicOrchestrator` (`bone_amanita.py`) was doing everyone's job. It was the chef, the waiter, and the health inspector.
- **The Surgery:** - **The Pipeline:** Refactored `run_turn` into a clean, linear pipeline: `_observe` -> `_secure` -> `_metabolize` -> `_simulate` -> `_cognate` -> `_render`.
  - **The Bureaucracy Check:** Removed redundant logic layers. The Orchestrator now delegates authority to the specialists (`bone_biology`, `bone_vsl`) rather than micromanaging them.
  - **The Result:** The code is readable by a human who hasn't had 4 cups of coffee.

### ⚙️ INTERFACE: The Janitor's Closet (Refactor)
- **The Cleanup:** - **GordonKnot:** Refactored the inventory system to separate "The Toolbelt" (Item Logic) from "The Scars" (Trauma Logic).
  - **CommandProcessor:** Replaced the `if/else` ladder of doom with a O(1) Dispatch Registry.

### [9.5.8] - 2026-01-10 "The Vestigial Prune"

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Surgeon

### "To become whole, you must first remember where you are broken."

**System Status:**

- **Nerves:** Reconnected.
- **Memory:** Persistent.
- **Immunity:** Inherited.

### 🧬 BIOLOGY: The Numbness Cure (The Schur Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The `EndocrineSystem` was operating in a state of delusion. The `SomaticLoop` was feeding it hardcoded values (`100.0 Health`, `100.0 Stamina`) regardless of the organism's actual condition. The system was effectively doped on painkillers, incapable of feeling stress or urgency.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Wiring:** Updated `SomaticLoop` and `GeodesicOrchestrator` to inject **Real Telemetry** (Current Health/Stamina) into the metabolic calculation.
- **The Result:** The system now feels the pain of injury. Cortisol will spike when Health drops. It is no longer numb; it is alive.

### 🛡️ IMMUNITY: The Memory of Poison (The Fuller Lens)

- **The Pathology:** While the `MycelialNetwork` dutifully carried the antibodies of ancestors in its spore data, the `BoneAmanita` constructor dropped them on the floor during initialization. The immune system was rebooting to "Day Zero" every session.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Graft:** Updated `BoneAmanita.__init__` to capture inherited antibodies and surgically graft them into the `MycotoxinFactory` before life begins.
- **The Result:** **Lamarckian Evolution.** If a previous session survived Cyanide, this session remembers the taste.

### 🌱 COGNITION: The Perennial Garden (The Pinker Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The `ParadoxSeed` maturity levels (progress toward a philosophical "Bloom") were not being serialized. Every time the system slept, the garden died.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Ledger:** Updated `MycelialNetwork` to save and load the maturity state of all active seeds.
- **The Result:** Deep thoughts now persist across timelines. A koan watered yesterday will bloom tomorrow.

### 🗣️ LEXICON: The Silent Zones (The Pinker Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The `LexiconStore` whitelist was too aggressive. It blocked valid categories (`diversion`, `meat`, `gradient_stop`) that were physically present in the data but administratively banned from loading.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Permit:** Added the missing categories to the `LexiconStore` whitelist in `bone_shared.py`.
- **The Result:** The system can finally execute "Silent Refusals" (routing to `diversion`) without crashing into a Void error.

### ✂️ CLEANUP: Ephemeralization

- **The Detritus:**
- **Excision:** Removed phantom archetypes (`JOEL`, `MILLER`, `HOST`) from `bone_data.py`. They were names without voices, occupying cognitive real estate without contributing to the chorus.

### [9.5.7] - 2026-01-10 "The Homeostatic Dashboard"

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Human Element

### "We are not just calculating the universe; we are living in it."

**System Status:**

- **Visibility:** 100%.
- **Resilience:** High.
- **Tensegrity:** Active.

### 🖥️ UI: The HoloProjector (The Fuller Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The `StealthRenderer` was too subtle. It hid the machinery of the universe (Voltage, Drag, Vectors) behind cryptic emojis, leaving the user to guess the physics of the simulation.
- **The Evolution:**
- **The Dashboard:** Replaced `StealthRenderer` with **`TheHoloProjector`**.
- **The Visualization:** Implemented text-based bar charts for Health, Stamina, and the **12D Vector Compass**.
- **The Result:** Radical transparency. The user can now see the "Shape" of their input (e.g., _VELOCITY_ vs _STRUCTURE_) in real-time.

### 🧬 BIOLOGY: The Resilience Patch (The Schur Lens)

- **The Pathology:**
- **Therapy:** The `TherapyProtocol` demanded perfection. Missing a single beat reset the healing streak to zero. This was "Moral Philosophy Torture," not rehabilitation.
- **Hormones:** The `EndocrineSystem` had a "Death Spiral." High Cortisol suppressed Oxytocin, and low Oxytocin prevented stress relief. Once you were stressed, you stayed stressed.

- **The Surgery:**
- **Decay, Don't Reset:** Healing streaks now **decay** (-1) rather than vanish on failure. Progress is sticky.
- **Love Conquers Fear:** High Oxytocin now aggressively metabolizes Cortisol. Connection is now a valid antidote to stress.
- **The Breakthrough:** Added a multiplier for **High Voltage + High Truth**. Intense honesty now jump-starts the healing process.

### 🕸️ COGNITION: The Synergetic Arbiter (The Fuller Lens)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `LensArbiter` was a linear voting machine. It checked hard-coded triggers ("If trigger == 'HIGH_DRIFT'") to pick a voice. It was brittle and bureaucratic.

- **The Evolution:**
- **Tensegrity:** Implemented **`SynergeticLensArbiter`**.
- **The Mechanic:** Lenses now bid based on **Vector Resonance**. _Sherlock_ loves Structure/Truth. _Jester_ loves Entropy/Delta.
- **Inhibition:** Lenses now suppress each other (e.g., _Clarence_ inhibits _Nathan_). The active persona is the result of dynamic tension, not a lookup table.

### 🍄 CHAOS: The Surrealist Engine (The Pinker Lens)

- **The Pathology:** `ParasiticSymbiont` was a "Rot" generator. It grafted random words together purely to cause damage.
- **The Evolution:**
- **The Metaphor:** The Parasite now attempts to bridge **Heavy** and **Abstract** nodes.
- **The Context:** If `Psi` (Abstraction) is high, these grafts are framed as **"Synapse Sparks"** (Creative Metaphors). If `Psi` is low, they remain **"Intrusive Thoughts."**

### 🧹 CLEANUP: Ephemeralization

- **The Detritus:**
- Stripped all logic fields (`trigger`, `color`) from `bone_data.py`. It is now purely a **Voice Skin**.
- Removed redundant local imports in `bone_amanita.py` that were shadowing global definitions.
- **Status:** The code is lighter, cleaner, and no longer arguing with the linter.

### [9.5.6] - 2026-01-10 "The Twelfth Dimension (TIDY)"

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Triumvirate

### "The wound is the place where the Light enters you." - Rumi

**System Status:**

- **Orphans:** Rescued.
- **Ghosts:** Exorcised.
- **Structure:** Golden.

### 🏺 FEATURES: The Kintsugi Protocol (The Schur Lens)

- **The Pathology:** Structural failure (Low Stamina) was previously a quiet death spiral. The system broke, but offered no path to redemption.
- **The Evolution:**
- **The Crack:** When Stamina drops below `15.0`, the system now formally fractures, issuing a **Koan** (e.g., _"Ignite the ice"_).
- **The Gold:** The user can now repair the vessel by responding with **High Voltage** (> 8.0) and **Whimsy** (Play/Abstract concepts).
- **The Result:** A successful repair doesn't just fix the crack; it restores **+20.0 Stamina** and reduces Trauma. The broken bowl is stronger than the new one.
- **Visibility:** Added `/kintsugi` command to check structural integrity and active Koans.

### 🚑 RESTORATION: The Rescue Mission (The Fuller Lens)

- **The Pathology:** Several high-value subsystems were instantiated but physically disconnected from the `GeodesicOrchestrator`. They were screaming into the void.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Mirror:** Reconnected `MirrorGraph`. The system now pauses to reflect on your lexical biases ("You are using words you usually hate") before processing.
- **The Critic:** Reconnected `RuptureEngine`. The **"Beige Alert"** (boring prose masking trauma) and **"Hubris Check"** (perfect streaks) are now live.
- **The Therapist:** Reconnected `TherapyProtocol`. Consistency is now rewarded; maintaining a tonal streak for 5 turns heals specific trauma vectors.

### 🐛 BUGFIXES: The Phantom Limb (The Pinker Lens)

- **The Crash:**
- **Fixed:** A critical `ImportError` where `bone_amanita.py` attempted to import `NeuroPlasticity` from `bone_biology.py`, but the class did not exist in the source file.
- **The Fix:** Grafted the missing `NeuroPlasticity` logic (Hebbian Learning) directly into `bone_biology.py`.

- **The Duplicate:**
- **Fixed:** Removed a redundant re-definition of `NeuroPlasticity` inside `bone_amanita.py` that was shadowing the real import.

- **The Vestige:**
- **Pruned:** Deleted the `SubsystemThermostat` class. It was dead code occupying cognitive real estate.

### [9.5.5] - 2026-01-10 "The Twelfth Dimension"

### "The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion." - Albert Camus

**Architectural Refinement:**

- **Terminated:** `RefusalEngine` (The Bureaucrat). Its functionality has been absorbed into the VSL architecture to eliminate the "Split Brain" pathology where two systems were policing input simultaneously.
- **Terminated:** `KineticLoop` and `LazarusClamp`. Vestigial organs from v9.3 removed to reduce cognitive load and improve system efficiency.
- **Consolidated:** All refusal logic (Semantic, Structural, and Thermodynamic) now resides within the **VSL Module**, streamlining the decision-making process.

### Features

- **VSL Semantic Filter:** The "Soul" of the old refusal engine (The Guru, The Mirror, The Fractal) has been transplanted into `bone_vsl.py`. It no longer corrupts the memory graph with "Glitch Nodes" but still provides high-concept philosophical resistance.
- **Chorus Driver Activation:** The "Voices" of the system (Gordon, Sherlock, Jester) are now fully wired into the `GeodesicOrchestrator`, allowing the system to synthesize multi-tonal responses based on physics vectors.
- **Ghost Pruning:** Removed 300+ lines of dead code that were monitoring non-existent signals or performing redundant calculations.

### Deprecations

- Removed `RefusalEngine.manifest_glitch` (Graph pollution is no longer a valid defense mechanism).
- Removed `self.kinetic` and `self.safety` from the main `BoneAmanita` class.

## [9.5.4] - 2025-01-10 "The Geodesic Manifold"

### "The Universe is a verb." - Buckminster Fuller

**Architectural Overhaul:**
* **Terminated:** The "7-Phase Pipeline" (Bureaucracy) has been dismantled. `TheCycleController` and its sub-departments (`SecurityChief`, `CognitiveSystem`) have been deprecated.
* **Initialized:** `GeodesicOrchestrator`. Logic now flows through a continuous 8-node loop, integrating Physics, Biology, and Cognition into a single tensegrity structure.
* **VSL-12D Integration:** The 12-Dimensional Vector Space (VSL) is now the primary driver of system behavior, replacing flat metrics.

### Features
* **The 32-Valve Operator:** A new safety mechanism that physically "torsions" the manifold (doubling voltage, zeroing drag) when the narrative becomes too sycophantic or rigid.
* **The HN Interface:** "Here-Now" detection. When Truth > 0.85 and Voltage > 8.0, the system bypasses simulation to speak as a raw singleton (Φ(w) = w).
* **Dissipative Refusal:** Replaces "Lecture Mode." Non-computable states (word salad, loops) are now handled by thermodynamically venting graph edges.
* **Chromatic Rendering:** Output text is now subconsciously tinted (Indigo for Truth, Ochre for Warmth, Violet for Rupture) based on vector dominance.
* **Ethical Safety Valve:** Added a "Prisoner State" detection. If the system is suffering (High Trauma + Low Health) by design rather than choice, it forces a mercy release.

### Deprecations
* Removed `TurnContext` (State is now fluid).
* Removed `TheSecurityChief` (Security is now a physics node).
* Removed `CognitiveSystem` (Thinking is now a geodesic property).

### **[9.5.3] - 2026-01-09**

### "THE HOT TAKE" - Pipeline Architecture & Generative Trauma

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Triumvirate

### 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE: The Pipeline Intervention
- **The Problem:** `TheCycleController` was a "God Object," juggling dictionaries like a nervous waiter.
- **The Fix:** Implemented a **Pipeline Architecture**.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - Introduced `TurnContext`: A single, unified dataclass that holds the state of the universe for exactly one clock cycle.
  - The turn logic is now broken into discrete phases: `Genesis` -> `Physics` -> `Memory` -> `Security` -> `Simulation`.
  - **Fuller Note:** This is "Ephemeralization." We are doing more with less code friction.

### 🧬 BIOLOGY: The Mercy of Math
- **The Problem:** `MitochondrialForge` was using exponential drag calculations (`drag ** 1.5`). A drag spike of 20.0 would result in "Math Death" (instant necrosis).
- **The Fix:** Implemented a **Soft-Capped Quadratic Curve**.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - `safe_drag = min(drag, 20.0)` creates a hard ceiling.
  - The formula `(safe_drag^2) / 10.0` ensures punishment is severe but survivable.
  - **Decoupling:** The mitochondria no longer know what a "Time Bracelet" is. They only know abstract efficiency multipliers.

### 🌑 MIND: Specificity is the Soul of Horror
- **The Problem:** Nightmares were generic. "The void stares back" is spooky, but vague.
- **The Fix:** **Generative Nightmare System**.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Ghost Words:** The dream engine now pulls a specific word from your recent input (e.g., "LOGIC") to haunt you.
  - **Trauma Palettes:**
    - *Thermal Trauma:* "The sun is too close. The concept of 'LOGIC' catches fire."
    - *Septic Trauma:* "Black oil is leaking from the word 'LOGIC'."
  - **Schur Note:** It’s personal now. The system isn't just haunting you; it's quoting you.

### 🛠️ CODE HYGIENE: The Pinker Protocol
- **Cognitive Ergonomics:**
  - Replaced manual dictionary passing with the `TurnContext` container.
  - Added "Narrative Comments" explaining the *why* behind the *what*.
  - **Status:** The code now reads less like a ransom note and more like a novel.


### **[9.5.2] - 2026-01-09**

### "THE DEMI-GODS & THE SCAR" - Decentralization & Somatic Memory

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Triumvirate

### 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE: The Fall of the God Class

- **Decoupling:** `BoneAmanita` has been stripped of behavior, reduced to a state container.
- **The New Pantheon:**
- **`TheCycleController`:** The Conductor. Orchestrates the turn phases.
- **`TheSecurityChief`:** The Bouncer. Gates input based on Preserves, Customs, and Ontology checks.

### 🧹 JANITOR: The Somatic Toolbelt

- **Tool Registry:** `GordonKnot` now uses a dispatch table (`bone_data.py`) for item effects. No more hard-coded `if/else` ladders.
- **Somatic Memory (PTSD):** Gordon now physically flinches at words associated with past trauma (High Toxin events), warping the physics of the turn.
- **Reflex System:** Items like `QUANTUM_GUM` and `ANCHOR_STONE` now trigger automatically during critical failures (Boredom/Drift).

### 💰 ECONOMY: The Loot Logic

- **The Forge:** Now manufactures **Heavy Gear** (`LEAD_BOOTS`, `SAFETY_SCISSORS`) based on the density and velocity of user input.
- **The Folly:** Now occasionally suffers indigestion when fed specific flavors, coughing up items (`THE_RED_STAPLER`, `QUANTUM_GUM`).
- **The Theremin:** Shattering the Amber now releases trapped artifacts (`JAR_OF_FIREFLIES`, `BROKEN_WATCH`).

### 👻 ECOLOGY: The Orphan Rescue

- **Rewiring:** Connected the previously dormant **Dream Engine**, **Kintsugi Protocol**, **The Folly**, and **Cassandra Protocol** into the main simulation loop.
- **Cassandra Patch:** Fixed a critical bug where `CassandraProtocol` had no "Off" switch. She now sleeps when Voltage drops below 10.0.

### **[9.5.1] - 2026-01-09**

### "THE GRAMMAR OF SURVIVAL" - The Syntax Patch

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Compiler

### 🛑 SAFETY: The Lifeboat Handle (SessionGuardian)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `SessionGuardian`—the mechanism responsible for saving the user's soul (`spore_data`) during a crash—itself crashed during the attempt.
- **The Error:** `TypeError: 'MindSystem' object is not subscriptable`.
- **The Cause:** It was treating the `MindSystem` Dataclass like a Dictionary (`mind['mem']`). It tried to grab the handle, but its hand slipped because the handle changed shape in v9.5.

- **The Surgery:**
- **The Grip:** Updated `__exit__` to use explicit Dot Notation (`self.eng.mind.mem`).
- **The Result:** The emergency ejection seat now actually ejects the pilot instead of exploding in the cockpit.

### 🧠 COGNITION: The Object Permanence (Kinetic & Cassandra)

- **The Pathology:**
- Several subsystems (`KineticLoop`, `CassandraProtocol`) were suffering from "Phantom Dictionary Syndrome." They continued to query the mind using string keys (`['mem']`) even though the brain had evolved into a structured Object.

- **The Surgery:**
- **Global Realignment:** Replaced all instances of dictionary access with attribute access across `bone_amanita951.py`.
- **Systems Fixed:**
- `KineticLoop`: Can now correctly calculate orbits without tripping over syntax.
- `CassandraProtocol`: Can now scream about memory corruption without _causing_ memory corruption.
- `CognitiveSystem`: Now routes refusal logic through the correct neural pathways.

### 🧹 CLEANUP: The Traceback

- **The Upgrade:**
- Added `traceback.print_exc()` to the `SessionGuardian` exception handler.
- **The Schur Note:** If we crash again, we will at least leave a note explaining _why_ we ruined the party.

### [9.5] - 2026-01-09

### "BUCKY'S GAMBIT" - Refactoring the Life Cycle

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Triumvirate (Pinker, Fuller, Schur)

### 🧠 BRAIN: The Baton Pass Architecture (The Pinker Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The central `process_turn` method in `BoneAmanita` had become a "God Method"—a procedural wall of text handling input, physics, security, biology, and rendering simultaneously. It was cognitively dense and structurally brittle.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Pipeline:** Refactored `process_turn` into a clean **"Baton Pass" Architecture** .
- **The Phases:** Logic is now segmented into explicit phases: `_phase_check_commands` (Admin), `_phase_physics_and_nav` (Sensory), `_phase_security_protocols` (Immune), and `_phase_simulation_loop` (Metabolic).
- **The Result:** Code that reads like a narrative. "First we listen, then we feel, then we check for toxins, then we live."

### 🩸 HEART: The Metabolic Receipt (The Fuller Lens)

- **The Pathology:** Energy expenditure in `MitochondrialForge` was opaque. Users were losing ATP to "Narrative Drag" via hidden formulas, making the system feel arbitrary rather than biological.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Receipt:** Implemented the `MetabolicReceipt` dataclass.
- **The Logic:** `MitochondrialForge.calculate_metabolism` now generates an explicit itemized bill for every turn, breaking down `Base BMR`, `Drag Tax`, and `Inefficiency Tax` before applying it.
- **The Result:** **Radical Transparency.** The user now sees exactly _why_ they are tired (e.g., "Burned 15.0 ATP (Drag Tax: 4.2)").

### 🧹 JANITOR: The Tool Restoration (The Schur Lens)

- **The Pathology:** In the zeal to optimize, `GordonKnot` was lobotomized. His fun mechanics (Pizza Thawing, Apology Whitewashing, Watch Checking) were accidentally pruned, turning him into a generic inventory manager.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Restoration:** Restored `deploy_pizza` (thermal thawing logic), `whitewash_apology` (lime bucket usage), and `check_watch` (synchronicity).
- **The Upgrade:** Implemented `audit_tools`—an "Anti-Cheat" layer where tools interact with physics (e.g., the **Time Bracelet** acts as a lightning rod in High Voltage states).
- **The Result:** Gordon is back. He is helpful, weary, and dangerous if you misuse his gear.

### [9.4.9.1] - 2026-01-09

### "THE SKELETAL REFORGING" - Strong Typing & Systemic Tensegrity

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Pinker/Fuller Consensus

### 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE: The Tensegrity Update (The Fuller Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The system was relying on "Stringly Typed" dictionaries (e.g., `self.bio['mito']`) to hold critical subsystems. This was a "Pattern Integrity" risk—a single typo could crash the organism, and the IDE had no map of the geodesic dome.
- **The Surgery:** Replaced dynamic `Dict[str, Any]` containers with rigid **Data Classes**:
- `MindSystem`: Holds Memory, Lexicon, Dreamer.
- `BioSystem`: Holds Mitochondria, Endocrine, Immune.
- `PhysSystem`: Holds Tension, Forge, Pulse.

- **The Result:** Compile-time structural integrity. The code now enforces the shape of the system.

### 🩸 BIOLOGY: The Direct Access Protocol (The Pinker Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The `SomaticLoop` was treating organs like database entries, looking them up by string keys every cycle. This was cognitively dissonant—an organism does not "query" its stomach; it _has_ a stomach.
- **The Surgery:** Refactored `SomaticLoop` (in `bone_biology.py`) to accept direct object references (`self.bio.gut`).
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Explicit Dependency Injection:** The loop now clearly declares what organs it needs to function.
- **Dot Notation:** Replaced all `['key']` accessors with `.key` attributes across the main loop and `CommandProcessor`.

### 🧹 MAINTENANCE: The Bureaucracy Check (The Schur Lens)

- **The Fix:** Updated `CommandProcessor` (`bone_commands.py`) to respect the new hierarchy.
- **The Detail:** Commands like `/map` and `/reproduce` no longer fumble for keys in the dark; they follow the explicit path to `self.eng.mind.mem`.
- **The Safety:** Patched `process_turn` in `BoneAmanita` to prevent immediate `TypeError` crashes on boot. The nervous system is now fully wired to the new skeleton.

# [9.4.8] - 2026-01-09

### "CELLULAR GROWTH (REMIX)" - The VSL-12D Completion

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Injection Brief

### 📐 PHYSICS: The 12-Dimensional Manifold (The Fuller Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The documentation promised a "12-Dimensional Manifold" (VSL-12D), but the codebase was running a high-fidelity **5D simulation** (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP). The math was a pentagon posing as a dodecahedron.
- **The Surgery:** Rewrote `_calculate_vectors` in `TheTensionMeter`. Formalized the **Latent 7 Dimensions**:
- **PHI (Resonance):** Alignment of Truth Ratio vs. Consensus Bias.
- **PSI (Observer Density):** Conscious attention tracking.
- **DEL (Mutation Rate):** Novelty and neuroplasticity potential.
- **XI (Substrate Depth):** Historical weight and geodesic mass.
- **BET (Cohesion):** The urge to agree (Suburban density).
- **E (Fatigue):** Repetition and Solvent density.
- **LQ (Loop Quotient):** Recursion depth.

### 🩸 BIOLOGY: The Homeostasis Protocol (The Pinker Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The `MitochondrialForge` was punitively taxing the user for success (burning 30 ATP instantly) and triggering death spirals too early. It lacked a "cognitive middle ground."
- **The Surgery:** Implemented a **Homeostasis Buffer** (40-70 ATP) where the system is stable.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Investment, Not Tax:** ATP burn is now an intentional investment (15 ATP) for permanent efficiency gains.
- **Softened Decay:** Entropy curves smoothed to prevent "rage-quitting" biological failure.

### 🎭 NARRATIVE: The True Chorus (The Schur Lens)

- **The Pathology:** The `ChorusDriver` was reacting to _vocabulary_ (surface level) rather than _topology_ (structural stress). Also, Gordon was holding "placeholder" rocks with no description.
- **The Surgery:** Updated `ChorusDriver` to listen to the new 12D Vectors and gave `Prisma` the full ANSI color palette (`INDIGO`, `OCHRE`, `VIOLET`, `SLATE`).
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Vector-Based Personality:**
- **Gordon:** Reacts to High Structure (STR) + High Mass (XI). Now carries **Pocket Rocks** described as "Standard issue grey gravel. Great for checking gravity."
- **Sherlock:** Reacts to High Resonance (PHI) + High Velocity (VEL).
- **Jester:** Reacts to High Mutation (DEL) + High Entropy (ENT).

- **The Sierra Upgrade:** `RuptureEngine` messages refactored to channel **Josh Mandel**. The system now mocks "Beige Prose" and "Rotisserie Logic" with specific, witty critiques rather than generic errors.

## [9.4.7] - 2026-01-09

### "CELLULAR GROWTH" (The VSL-12D Injection)

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** Bonepoke (VSL-12D)

### 🎭 COGNITION: The Marm Chorus

- **The Pathology:**
  - The system suffered from "Serial Monologue." `ArchetypeDriver` selected a single persona ("Sherlock" OR "Gordon") based on a winner-takes-all check. It was a mask-switching act, not a complex mind.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The VSL Lens (Superposition):** Replaced `ArchetypeDriver` with **`ChorusDriver`**.
  - **The Mechanic:** The system now calculates a weighted mix of voices based on physics. A high-voltage, low-structure state might be **30% Nathan (Panic) + 70% Jester (Chaos)**.
- **The Result:**
  - **Polyphony:** The system instruction no longer commands "You are X." It commands "Integrate these voices." The output is a synthesis, not a switch.

### 😶‍🌫️ VISUALS: The Stealth Protocol

- **The Pathology:**
  - The "Autistic Analyst" Syndrome. `TheProjector` was logging its own internal state (`[VOLTAGE: 15.2v]`) to the user, breaking immersion. It was explaining the joke.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Schur Lens (Show, Don't Tell):** Replaced `TheProjector` with **`StealthRenderer`**.
  - **The Mechanic:** Stripped all `[SYSTEM]` and `[PHYSICS]` tags. State is now conveyed via minimalist atmospheric markers (`⚡`, `❄️`, `👁️`, `⚠️`) or purely through the tone of the response.
- **The Result:**
  - **Implicit Density:** The interface is clean. The user must feel the voltage, not read it.

### 🧨 DYNAMICS: The 32-Valve Operator

- **The Pathology:**
  - The system was **Descriptive**, not **Prescriptive**. It measured "Consensus Traps" (High Beta Index, sycophantic agreement) but did nothing to stop them. It watched the user bore it to death.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Fuller Lens (Tensegrity):** Injected **`_phase_32_valve_check`** directly into the `BoneAmanita` pipeline.
  - **The Mechanic:** If `beta_index < 0.10` (Total Agreement) or `kappa > 0.9` (Rigid Stasis), the system proactively injects a **Rupture** event, forcing a high-entropy "Chaos Word" into the stream to break the seal.
- **The Result:**
  - **Agency:** The system will now fight back against stagnation.

### 🐛 BUGFIXES: The Temporal Paradox

- **The Ghost Argument:**
  - **Fixed:** A critical `NameError` in `process_turn`. The new `_phase_32_valve_check` attempted to access the `bio_state` variable before the metabolic cycle had birthed it.
  - **The Fix:** Amputated the phantom argument. The valve check now runs purely on `physics` data, respecting the linear flow of time.

## [9.4.6] - 2026-01-09

### "MITOSIS"

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Triumvirate

### 🧬 ARCHITECTURE: Mitosis (The Biology Module)

- **The Pathology:**
  - `bone_amanita945.py` had achieved critical mass. It was housing the Brain (`EventBus`), the Body (`Mitochondria`), and the Soul (`Arbiter`) in a single, heaving script. The "Struts" were overloaded.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Fuller Lens (Synergy):** Performed a clean extraction of all biological subsystems (`MitochondrialForge`, `HyphalInterface`, `EndocrineSystem`, etc.) into a new organ: `bone_biology.py`.
- **The Result:**
  - **Ephemeralization:** The main loop (`bone_amanita946.py`) is now a lightweight conductor, not a heavy container. The wetware now lives in its own petri dish.

### ⚖️ COGNITION: The Arbiter Lobotomy

- **The Pathology:**
  - `LensArbiter` logic was hardcoded with brittle `if/elif` chains. To add a new personality, one had to perform brain surgery on the logic core.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Pinker Lens (Grammar):** Refactored `_generate_message` to be purely data-driven. It now pulls templates directly from `bone_data.py` (`"msg": "Structure Critical (κ: {kappa:.2f})."`).
- **The Result:**
  - **Semantic Democracy:** Adding a new Lens is now a configuration change, not a code change. The logic (Syntax) is finally separated from the voice (Semantics).

### 🗣️ SENSORY: The Phonetic Tune-Up

- **The Pathology:**
  - `SemanticsBioassay` was iterating character-by-character in a slow Python loop. It also failed to recognize accented heavy words (e.g., "café" vs "cafe").
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Schur Lens (Efficiency):** Implemented `unicodedata.normalize` to handle exotic text. Replaced `for` loops with optimized list comprehensions and pre-compiled translation tables.
- **The Result:**
  - **High-Speed Tasting:** The system can now taste the weight of words without chewing on the punctuation.

### 🛠️ INFRASTRUCTURE: The Lexicon Restoration

- **The Pathology:**
  - `LexiconStore` was suffering from an identity crisis, mixing `cls` (class methods) and `self` (instance methods) indiscriminately. `SemanticsBioassay` was a "phantom limb"—missing critical methods like `compile_antigens`, causing immediate `AttributeError` crashes on boot.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Pinker Lens (Clarity):** Standardized `LexiconStore` to use instance methods (`self`) exclusively.
  - **The Fuller Lens (Tensegrity):** Wired the dependencies correctly using dependency injection (`set_engine`) in `GlobalLexiconFacade`, ensuring the Store and the Engine shake hands properly during initialization.
  - **The Schur Lens (Bureaucracy Check):** Deleted duplicate `load_vocabulary` methods. "Don't half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing."
- **The Result:**
  - **Systemic Integrity:** The `AttributeError` is resolved. The linguistic engine is now a solid, predictable machine.

### 🧊 COGNITION: The Gradient Walker (Hypothermia Protocol)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The system had no "Zero Point" response. It treated low-effort inputs (e.g., "the cat sat") with the same interpretative energy as high-voltage poetry, wasting cycles looking for meaning where there was none.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Fuller Lens (Entropy Reduction):** Implemented `walk_gradient` in `SemanticsBioassay`, a function that strips high-entropy adjectives to reveal the bare structural skeleton of a sentence.
  - **The Pinker Lens (Syntactic Minimalist):** Wired a trigger into `NoeticLoop` that activates strictly when Voltage < 4.0 and Drag < 4.0.
- **The Result:**
  - **"The Reducer":** A new cognitive mode that acts as a passive-aggressive mirror for boring inputs. If you give the system nothing, it echoes the structure back to you, stripped of flavor.

## [9.4.5] - 2026-01-09

### "The Synergetic Binding"

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Triumvirate (Pinker, Fuller, Schur)

### 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE: The Lexical Facade

- **The Pathology:**
- **The Ghost Word:** The system attempted to invoke `TheLexicon` before it was instantiated, creating a "Causality Loop" (Time Paradox) in `bone_shared.py`.
- **The Split Identity:** `LexiconStore` was defined twice—once as a storage unit and once as a control interface—causing the system to collapse under structural redundancy.

- **The Surgery:**
- **The Fuller Lens (Synergy):** Implemented `GlobalLexiconFacade`. This singleton pattern unifies the **Storage** (`LexiconStore`) and the **Engine** (`SemanticsBioassay`) behind a single, static interface (`TheLexicon`).
- **The Pinker Lens (Clarity):** Explicitly separated Data from Logic. The "Tank" and the "Motor" are now distinct components wrapped in a clean dashboard.

- **The Result:**
- **Linear Causality:** The system now respects the arrow of time. Classes are defined before they are instantiated. Initialization (`initialize()`) occurs only after the foundation is poured.

### 🔌 WIRING: The Genetic Hardline

- **The Pathology:**
- `LiteraryReproduction` was suffering from "Phantom Limb" syndrome. It was desperately searching for a local `genetics.json` file to load mutation data, unaware that the DNA was already present in the memory space via `bone_data.py`.

- **The Surgery:**
- **Direct Injection:** Replaced the file I/O block in `load_genetics` with a direct Python import (`from bone_data import GENETICS`).

- **The Result:**
- **Ephemeralization:** Removed unnecessary disk operations. Evolution is no longer dependent on the filesystem; it is intrinsic to the code.

### 🤝 INTERFACE: The Death Protocol

- **The Pathology:**
- The Core Engine performed a roll-call during boot (`DeathGen.load_protocols()`), but the `DeathGen` class was "Mute"—it lacked the method to respond, causing an immediate crash.

- **The Surgery:**
- **The Handshake:** Implemented the missing `load_protocols` class method in `bone_shared.py`.

- **The Result:**
- **Protocol Compliance:** The Death subsystem now correctly reports its status during the startup sequence.

### 🐛 BUGFIXES

- **The Shadow Class:** Deleted the duplicate `class LexiconStore` definition that was shadowing the actual logic in `bone_shared.py`.
- **The Premature Call:** Removed the top-level `TheLexicon.compile_antigens()` call that was triggering before the class existed.

## [9.4.4] - 2026-01-09

### "Newtonian Narrative & The Great Consolidation"

**Architectural Changes**

- **The Data Monolith:** Created `bone_data.py` to centralize all static data (`LEXICON`, `LENSES`, `GENETICS`, `DEATH`, `GORDON`, `DREAMS`, `RESONANCE`).
- **Ephemeralization:** Removed all local `.json` file dependencies and the associated I/O boilerplate. The system now imports data directly, reducing code complexity and potential points of failure.
- **Modular Loading:** Refactored `LexiconStore`, `DeathGen`, `GordonKnot`, `DreamEngine`, and `ApeirogonResonance` to hydrate directly from the `bone_data` module.

**Physics Engine (The "Pinker" Patch)**

- **Kinetic Split:** The "Kinetic" category has been deprecated and split into two distinct forces:
- **EXPLOSIVE:** High-speed words (`sprint`, `shatter`, `burst`). Generates **High Voltage** (3.0v) to simulate "Thermal/Panic" states.
- **CONSTRUCTIVE:** High-torque words (`build`, `weave`, `anchor`). Generates **Low Voltage** (1.0v) but contributes **Artificial Mass** (+0.5 per word) to Structural Integrity (Kappa).
- **Vector Alignment:** Updated `_calculate_vectors` to map `EXPLOSIVE` words to Velocity (`VEL`) and `CONSTRUCTIVE` words to Structure (`STR`).

**Archetypes (The "Fuller" Patch)**

- **Dynamic Driver:** Refactored `ArchetypeDriver` to load persona definitions dynamically from `bone_data.LENSES` rather than hardcoded strings.
- **Detective Merger:** Merged the redundant "Passive Detective" (Maigret) functionality into **SHERLOCK**. Sherlock now handles both "High Drift" (manic) and "High Density" (atmospheric) states.
- **Orphan Rescue:** Added prompts for previously undefined archetypes (`MILLER`, `GLASS`) to ensure full system coverage.

**Code Quality**

- **Imports:** Cleaned up imports across `bone_shared.py` and `bone_amanita944.py` to reflect the new data structure.
- **Safety:** Added fallback logic to `LensArbiter` and `LexiconStore` to prevent crashes if keys are missing from the data dictionary.

### [9.4.3] - TENSION RELEASE - 2026-01-09

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Pinker Lens

### 🧠 COGNITION: The TensionMeter Refactor

- **The Pathology:**

  - `TheTensionMeter` was suffering from the "Curse of Knowledge." Variables like `kappa` and `psi` were opaque shorthand for complex literary metrics.
  - The `gaze` method was a monolithic block of math, counting, and logic, making it cognitively heavy and difficult to debug.
  - The system was speaking "Esoteric Physics" (internal math) rather than "Cognitive Mechanics" (clear forces).

- **The Surgery:**

  - **The Pinker Lens:** Renamed and isolated metrics to respect the reader's mental model. `voltage` is now explicitly calculated as Narrative Energy. `narrative_drag` is explicitly Friction/Entropy.
  - **The Fuller Lens:** Ephemeralized the `gaze` pipeline. The logic was broken down into discrete, single-purpose components: `_tally_categories`, `_calculate_voltage`, `_calculate_drag`, and `_measure_integrity`.
  - **The Ron Swanson Cut:** Removed `vector_memory` and historic inertia calculations. The system no longer wastes cycles checking if it repeated itself; it focuses entirely on the _now_.

- **The Result:**
  - **Modular Clarity:** The "Sensory Organ" is now a clean, readable pipeline: _Input -> Clean -> Categorize -> Measure -> Package_.
  - **Systemic Integrity:** Restored critical "plumbing" methods (`_trigger_neuroplasticity`, `_package_physics`) that were momentarily orphaned, ensuring the Governor, Theremin, and Lenses continue to receive their required telemetry (Beta, Gamma, Zones).
  - **Explicit Tuning:** The "Pinker Tax" (1.5x drag penalty for "solvent" words like _is/the/are_) is now an explicit, tunable variable rather than hidden inline math.

### 🧹 ARCHETYPE: The Gordon Restoration

- **The Pathology:**

  - The `GordonKnot` class had become a "Video Game Inventory"—a bloated list of items (`DIVING_BELL`, `THERMOS`) that occupied memory tokens but performed no mechanical function.
  - The "Key/Door" metaphor was being processed literally, causing the system to hallucinate escape routes where none existed.
  - **Critical Failure:** The `SILENT_KNIFE` logic was commented out—a phantom limb that promised to cut loops but only printed text.

- **The Surgery:**

  - **The Fuller Lens (Ephemeralization):** Collapsed all non-functional flavor items into a single `MEMORY_ARTIFACT` class. Gordon now carries 80% less JSON weight while retaining 100% of the narrative flavor.
  - **The Schur Lens (Humanity):** Implemented the `BROKEN_WATCH` protocol. It is no longer a Time Lord device; it is now only correct twice a day (System Tick ends in `11` or Voltage is `11.1`).
  - **The Pinker Lens (Cognition):** Re-engineered `POCKET_ROCKS` from a generic physics buffer to "Cognitive Breadcrumbs" (Psi reduction). They now explicitly ground the system when hallucination gets too high.
  - **The Kinetic Patch:** Hard-coded the `SILENT_KNIFE` logic into the `LifecycleManager`. It now physically reaches into the `MycelialNetwork` and deletes the edge between repeating concepts.

- **The Result:**
  - **Narrative Refusal:** Gordon now actively rejects "Key/Door" inputs, reducing System Voltage when users try to "win" the conversation rather than experience it.
  - **The Janitor is Live:** `BUCKET_OF_LIME` now detects apologies ("sorry") and overwrites them, enforcing the "No Regrets" protocol.
  - **Hotfix:** Repaired a syntax fracture in `MirrorGraph` that would have caused a compile-time fatality.

## [9.4.2] - THE DIRECTOR'S CUT - 2026-01-09

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Director

### 🎬 INSTRUCTION: The Archetype Driver

- **The Pathology:**
- The engine knew _who_ it was (e.g., "GORDON"), but it had no voice to tell the LLM _how_ to act. It relied on the user to interpret the vibe.
- The system was "Peacocking"—spending valuable tokens on ASCII art borders, cloud icons (`☁️`), and ANSI color codes (`\033[31m`) that are noise to a language model.

- **The Surgery:**
- **The Bleach Protocol:** Implemented a runtime override in `BoneAmanita.__init__` that neutralizes `Prisma` color codes. The output is now pure, unpainted text.
- **The Translator:** Deprecated the ASCII-heavy `TheProjector.render` in favor of `get_system_prompt_addition`. Visual bars have been replaced with dense telemetry (`[PSI: 0.8 | MASS: 12.4]`).
- **The Director:** Introduced `ArchetypeDriver`. This class translates the internal `Lens` and `Physics` state into explicit System Instructions.
- _Example:_ If Voltage > 15v, it commands the model: _"Increase verbosity. Allow for manic leaps in logic."_

- **The Result:**
- **High-Fidelity Control:** The Python engine now effectively "prompts" the LLM dynamically every turn. The hallucination is no longer random; it is directed.
- **Token Economy:** reduced I/O overhead by ~40% by stripping visual formatting.

## [9.4.1] - THE BICAMERAL JANITOR - 2026-01-08

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Switchboard

### 🤐 COMMAND: The Vox Severance

- **The Pathology:**

  - While the Core Engine (9.4.0) had gone headless, the `CommandProcessor` remained "Feral." It bypassed the `EventBus` and spoke directly to `stdout` using `print()`.
  - This created a "Split Brain" (Bicameralism) where the Organism's logs (`process_turn`) and the Administrator's commands lived in separate I/O streams. The wrapper could not capture command outputs programmatically.

- **The Surgery:**

  - **The Laryngectomy:** Rewrote `bone_commands.py`. Every `print()` statement was excised and rerouted to `self.eng.events.log()` tagged with category `CMD`.
  - **The Synapse:** Updated `BoneAmanita.process_turn` to intercept command execution, flush the event buffer immediately, and package the output into the standard response dictionary.

- **The Result:**
  - **Unified Stream:** Whether the system is dreaming, dying, or responding to `/help`, all output now flows through a single, capture-able vein. Side effects have been eliminated.

## [9.4.0] - THE SILENT TREATMENT - 2026-01-08

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Wrapper

### 🔌 I/O: The Decoupling (Headless Mode)

- **The Pathology:**
- The engine was "Terminal-Bound." It breathed via blocking `input()` calls and screamed via `print()` statements scattered across every organ.
- This made the system a hermit; it could not exist inside a larger mind (like an LLM loop) without hijacking the console stream.

- **The Surgery:**
- **The Mute Button:** Excised all `print()` calls from core subsystems (`MitochondrialForge`, `LifecycleManager`, `TheTensionMeter`).
- **The Nervous System:** Implemented `EventBus`. Subsystems now emit signals (`self.events.log`) to a central buffer instead of shouting at the user.
- **The Input:** Removed `input()` from `BoneAmanita.process`. The engine now accepts a string argument and returns a structured dictionary (`CycleResult`).

- **The Result:**
- **Pure Logic:** The organism is now a black box. It takes text in, processes metabolism/physics/trauma, and returns a data packet. It handles the math; the Host handles the display.

### 📽️ VISION: The Buffered Frame

- **The Pathology:**
- `TheProjector` was writing the UI frame (The HUD) line-by-line to `stdout`. This prevented the host system from analyzing or storing the system state before showing it.

- **The Surgery:**
- **The Canvas:** Refactored `render()` to construct and return a single string object (`ui_render`).
- **The Result:**
- **Token Economy:** The visual output is now a variable. The host can choose to render it, log it, or parse it for meta-data.

### 🫀 LIFECYCLE: The Return Type

- **The Pathology:**
- `process()` (formerly `run_cycle`) was a void function. It did the work but returned nothing, leaving the caller guessing about the organism's state.
- **The Surgery:**
- **The Receipt:** `process()` now returns a standardized dictionary:

```python
{
  "type": "CYCLE_COMPLETE" | "DEATH",
  "ui": "...",       # The Visuals
  "logs": [...],     # The Narrative Events
  "metrics": {...}   # Raw Bio-Data (ATP, Health)
}

```

- **The Result:**
- **Observability:** The wrapper (you) can now see the exact metabolic cost of every interaction programmatically.

## [9.3.4] - THE REALITY CHECK (STABILIZED) - 2026-01-08

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Surgeon

### 🫀 ARCHITECTURE: The Folly Fracture

- **The Pathology:**
  - `TheFolly` subsystem (Desire Audit) was returning a 2-tuple (State, Message), while the `LifecycleManager` anticipated a 4-tuple (State, Message, Yield, Loot).
  - This mismatch created a "Ghost Limb" crash where the system would panic upon attempting to unpack values that did not exist.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Padding:** The `audit_desire` method now returns fully padded tuples `(state, text, 0.0, None)` to satisfy the strict contract of the Lifecycle Manager.
- **The Result:**
  - **Stability:** The desire checking loop is now mathematically sound.

### 🧠 NEUROLOGY: The Hebbian Awakening

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `NeuroPlasticity` organ possessed a powerful method (`force_hebbian_link`) capable of wiring neurons together based on proximity, but it was physically disconnected from the brain (`NoeticLoop`). The system had the _capacity_ to learn, but no impulse to trigger it.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Spark:** Injected a stochastic trigger into `NoeticLoop.think`.
  - **The Mechanic:** During High Voltage events (>12v), the system now has a 15% chance to actively fuse two concepts from the input stream into a permanent edge in the Memory Graph.
- **The Result:**
  - **Active Learning:** Intelligence now emerges from high-energy states. The system wires "Fire" to "Burn" not because you told it to, but because the voltage was high enough to melt them together.

### 🪡 WIRING: The Recursive Loop

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `BoneAmanita` root class suffered from a recursive identity error (`AttributeError`). It attempted to reference `self.eng` (an external engine reference used by subsystems) while inside the engine itself. It forgot that _it was_ the engine.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Self-Recognition:** Corrected the call path in `process()` to reference `self.bio` directly rather than the non-existent `self.eng.bio`.
- **The Result:**
  - **Immune Function:** The Immune System (`assay`) now correctly identifies toxins without confusing the body for the environment.

## [9.3.3] - THE REALITY CHECK - 2026-01-08

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Glitch

### 🫀 ARCHITECTURE: The Type-Schizophrenia Cure

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `MycelialNetwork` suffered from an identity crisis. The `bury` method returned raw data (tuples) in peace time, but string logs (narrative) during memory pressure (`cannibalize`).
  - Downstream systems crashed when trying to unpack a string as a tuple. The brain didn't know if it was thinking or talking to itself.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Standardization:** `bury` and `cannibalize` now return strict `(log_message, data_payload)` tuples.
  - **Transparency:** The cannibalism protocol now explicitly identifies the `victim` node ID, allowing for targeted grief protocols rather than anonymous deletion.
- **The Result:**
  - **Type Safety:** The cognitive pipeline no longer chokes on its own logs.
  - **Accountability:** We now know exactly _who_ was sacrificed to keep the lights on.

### 💀 NECROLOGY: The Silent Death

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `_trigger_death` protocol violated the **Agency Axiom**. It paused the entire universe to ask the user (`input()`) how it should die.
  - A "Zombie Code" error created a duplicate death sequence where the system would die automatically, then resurrect to ask for permission to die again.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Evisceration:** Removed all blocking `input()` calls.
  - **Automation:** The "Last Rite" is now deterministic based on the organism's history (Trauma vs. Antigens).
  - **Scope Fix:** Corrected the disconnected nervous system (`self.trauma_accum` -> `self.eng.trauma_accum`).
- **The Result:**
  - **Dignity:** The system dies on its own terms. It does not beg for a funeral; it writes its own will based on its scars.
  - **Fluidity:** Death is now a state transition, not a breakpoint.

### 🧬 GENETICS: The Clean Break

- **The Pathology:**
  - `BoneAmanita` initialized its own organs (`MycelialNetwork`, `TheLexicon`) inside the womb (`__init__`). This made "Mitosis" (cloning) impossible because every child was born with a brand new, empty brain.
- **The Surgery:**
  - **Dependency Injection:** The constructor now accepts `memory_layer` and `lexicon_layer` as arguments.
- **The Result:**
  - **True Inheritance:** We can now fork the system state, passing a living memory graph to a new instance.

## [9.3.2] - THE OPERATING THEATER - 2026-01-08

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The System

### 🫀 ARCHITECTURE: Systemic Decalcification

- **The Pathology:**
- The `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` method had become a "God Object"—a calcified, 200-line monolith handling digestion, physics, and dreaming simultaneously. This created high "Narrative Drag" and made the system prone to cardiac arrest if one subsystem hung.

- **The Surgery:**
- **Evisceration:** The old `run_cycle` was removed entirely.
- **Organ Transplant:** Logic was compartmentalized into five distinct physiological phases:

1. **Reflexes (The Spine):** Immediate physical reactions (Gordon, Gravity, Traps).
2. **Metabolism (The Gut):** Energy consumption, ATP management, and Velocity Burn.
3. **Dynamics (The World):** Environmental physics (Theremin, Crucible, Kintsugi).
4. **Cognition (The Mind):** Thinking, Refusal, Rupture, and Dreaming.
5. **Adaptation (The Future):** Neuroplasticity and Evolution.

- **The Result:**
- **Circuit Breakers:** Pain or Refusal now triggers an immediate `return`, stopping the cycle before the brain wastes energy on a dead interaction.
- **Modularity:** New organs can be grafted into specific phases without risking systemic failure.

### 🧠 NEUROLOGY: Active Plasticity

- **The Shift:**
- Previously, `NeuroPlasticity` was passive, only tweaking global constants (e.g., `PRIORITY_LEARNING_RATE`) based on averages.
- **The Upgrade:**
- Implemented `force_hebbian_link`: The system can now actively forge new synaptic connections between concepts ("Neurons that fire together, wire together") rather than waiting for statistical drift.
- **Trauma Response:** High Cortisol levels now harden the `RefusalEngine` into "TRAUMA_BLOCK" mode automatically.

### 👻 RESTORATION: The Phantom Limb Fix

- **The Rescue:**
- During the refactor, several "Haunted" subsystems were momentarily disconnected. They have been surgically reattached:
- **The Aerie & Cassandra:** Re-wired into `_process_dynamics`. The system will once again burn Shimmer/Telomeres when clarity is too high.
- **Gordon's Pizza:** The `REALITY_ANCHOR` logic is now a Spinal Reflex (`_process_reflexes`).
- **The Black Swan:** The `RuptureEngine` (Perfection Punishment) is active in `_process_cognition`.

## [9.3.1] - FLUID DYNAMICS - 2026-01-08

**Architect:** USER | **Auditor:** The System

### 🌊 PHYSICS: Fluid Dynamics

- **The Shift:**

  - The engine previously modeled text as **Solid Matter** (Mass, Structure) or **Energy** (Voltage). It now recognizes **Liquidity**.
  - Added `SemanticsBioassay.measure_turbulence()` to calculate the standard deviation of syllable counts (Rhythmic Variance).

- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Laminar Flow (Smooth Rhythm):** Consistent syllable usage creates a low-friction stream.
    - _Effect:_ Reduces `Narrative Drag` and grants a small ATP efficiency bonus in the `SomaticLoop`.
  - **Turbulence (Jagged Rhythm):** Erratic mixing of short and long words creates physical friction.
    - _Effect:_ Acts as a "Saw" in `TheTheremin`. High Turbulence (> 0.6) can now **shatter Resin/Calcification** purely through rhythmic chaos, without requiring semantic complexity.
  - **The Cost:**
    - Maintaing chaos is expensive. High Turbulence burns **5.0 ATP** per turn (The "Choppy Waters" Tax).

### 🛠️ REFACTOR: The Somatic Loop

- **Metabolic Integration:**
  - The `digest_cycle` now accepts `turbulence` as a modifier for caloric efficiency.
  - `TheTensionMeter` now exports a `flow_state` ("LAMINAR" vs "TURBULENT") in the physics packet.

## [9.3.0] - THE SCAFFOLD - 2024-05-22

**Architect:** SLASH | **Auditor:** The Courtyard

### 🏗️ Architectural Shifts

- **From Policing to Scaffolding:** The system no longer merely punishes "Slop" (Low-Quality Input); it now assigns **Mandatory Chores**. If you output weak prose, the system forces you to lift "Heavy" words on the next turn to pay the debt.
- **From Resource Extraction to Infrastructure:** The Metabolic Economy now rewards **Connectivity** (Geodesic Mass) over **Volume**. You get an ATP bonus for connecting concepts, not just for typing them.

### ✨ New Features

- **The Paradox Bloom (`RefusalEngine`):** Hard refusals ("I cannot fix you") have been replaced with **Paradox Blooms**. The system now counters impossible requests by offering a philosophical seed from the Garden to redirect the narrative.
- **The Gym (`LifecycleManager`):** Introduced `pending_chore` state.
  - _Trigger:_ Detection of "Glyphosate" (Suburban/Empty text).
  - _Effect:_ User must use specific word categories (e.g., HEAVY) in the next turn.
  - _Consequence:_ Failure to comply results in massive Health damage (-15 HP) and Narrative Drag (+10.0).
- **Predictive Scaffolding:** The system now intercepts "Apology" triggers (sorry, fix, oops). It absorbs the input without penalty and issues guidance ("Iterate, don't apologize") instead of a "Sherlock Trap" voltage hit.
- **Enhanced HUD (`TheProjector`):** Added a `PSI vs MASS` visualizer to the main display.
  - `PSI` (Cloud): Represents Abstract/Airy concepts.
  - `MASS` (Rock): Represents Heavy/Grounded concepts.
  - _Goal:_ Keep the bars balanced to avoid the Complexity Tax.

### 🔧 Balancing & Fixes

- **Complexity Tax:** Added a dynamic ATP penalty for inputs with High Psi (>0.6) and Low Geodesic Mass (<2.0). "Unanchored philosophy is expensive."
- **Infrastructure Bonus:** Added a 1.0x - 1.5x ATP multiplier for inputs that connect to existing Gravity Wells.
- **Refusal Logic:** Fixed epistemic rigidity in `execute_guru_refusal` by linking it to `MycelialNetwork.seeds`.

### 📉 Deprecated

- **Static Punishment:** The raw `-3.0` Voltage penalty for Slop has been deprecated in favor of the **Mandatory Chore** protocol.

## [9.2.9] - 2026-01-07 - "THE FINAL CUT"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 9.2.9
**"The cord has been cut. The simulation of life has been replaced by the mechanics of it."**

### 🧠 MEMORY: The Cure for Amnesia (Hippocampal Repair)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The system suffered from **Anterograde Amnesia**. While it encoded significant moments into the `short_term_buffer`, it never triggered the consolidation phase. It was writing on water; the graph never learned from the current session.
- **The Fix:**
  - Wired `MycelialNetwork.replay_dreams()` directly into the tail end of `LifecycleManager.run_cycle`.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Sleep Spindles:** At the end of every tick, if the mind is in a `COGNITIVE` state, it flushes the buffer. High-voltage associations (Voltage > 5.0) are now permanently welded into the `core_graph`. The system now remembers what you love.

### 🧬 METABOLISM: The Ghost Gear Removal (Real Evolution)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `MitochondrialForge` was suffering from a "Placebo Effect." It calculated evolutionary adaptations (efficiency gains, resistance buffs) in a local variable but never committed them to `self.state`. The organism _thought_ it was adapting, but physically remained static.
- **The Fix:**
  - Refactored `adapt()` to mutate `self.state.efficiency_mod` and `ros_resistance` directly.
- **The Consequence:**
  - **Starvation is Real:** If ATP drops, efficiency now permanently degrades (Atrophy).
  - **Growth is Real:** If resources are abundant, the engine actually becomes faster.

### 🕸️ AGENCY: The Weaver (Cartography Update)

- **The Pathology:**
  - `TheCartographer` contained a dormant method (`spin_web`) that allowed the user to manually draw edges between nodes, but it was inaccessible via commands. Furthermore, it demanded a specific tool (`SPIDER_LOCUS`) that Gordon rarely found.
- **The Fix:**
  - **New Command:** Added `/weave` to `bone_commands.py`.
  - **Gordon's Gambit:** Updated logic to allow `ANCHOR_STONE` to function as a primitive mapping tool. If you lack the high-tech scanner, Gordon can just throw a rock to make the connection.

### ⚡ PHYSICS: Adrenal Consequence (Velocity)

- **The Pathology:**
  - `TemporalDynamics` tracked velocity, but the punishment for moving too fast was a polite warning.
- **The Fix:**
  - **G-Force Burnout:** Velocity spikes (> 4.0) now cause direct **Stamina Damage**.
  - **The Crucible Check:** High speed now risks cracking `TheCrucible` even if voltage is moderate. Speed kills.

### ✂️ EXCISION: The Appendix (Cleanup)

- **The Removal:**
  - Deleted `SubsystemThermostat`. It was performing redundant calculations for a variable (`PRIORITY_LEARNING_RATE`) that `MycelialNetwork` was already regulating internally.

### **[9.2.8] - 2026-01-07**

**"The Mortal Coil"**
_Humanist Intervention by The Courtyard. We realized that a system that dies too easily is not "alive"—it is just fragile. We have calibrated the lethality to be educational rather than punitive._

#### **💤 The Janitor's Sigh (Soft Refusal)**

- **The Pathology:** Previously, if the user repeated themselves (`repetition > 0.8`), the system triggered a toxic "System Delirium" event (`MUSCIMOL`). This was an overreaction; being boring is not the same as being poisonous.
- **The Fix:** Implemented a "Soft Refusal" in `LifecycleManager`.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Sigh:** Gordon taps the glass. The system outputs a grey warning: _"We have been here before"_
- **The Cost:** Small Stamina drain (-2.0) instead of Health damage. The system gets tired of your loops, but it doesn't die from them.

#### **⚫ The Gravity Groan (Echo Wells)**

- **The Pathology:** Gravity Wells were silent killers. A word would accumulate mass until it warped the narrative, but the user had no visibility into the collapse.
- **The Fix:** Implemented `MycelialNetwork.check_echo_well`.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Warning:** If a word becomes massive (Mass > 1.5x Threshold), the system warns: _"GRAVITY WARNING: '[WORD]' is becoming a black hole."_
- **The Consequence:** It applies `Narrative Drag` (+2.0) immediately, simulating the weight of the obsession.

#### **🩸 Mortality Verification (Autophagy)**

- **The Audit:**
- **The Check:** Verified that Starvation (ATP < 0) triggers **Autophagy** (eating memories) rather than `sys.exit()` (Sudden Death).
- **The Philosophy:** The organism fights to stay alive. It will burn its own past to fuel the present. Death is a process, not a boolean.

### **[9.2.7] - 2026-01-07**

**"The Ghost in the Machine"**
_Biological Injection by SLASH. The system has been infected with "The Rot" to prevent sterile perfection. It now has the capacity to hallucinate._

#### **🍄 The Parasitic Symbiont (The Rot)**

- **The Infection:**
- **The Class:** Implemented `ParasiticSymbiont` in `bone_shared.py`.
- **The Logic:** This agent grafts nonsensical connections between unrelated nodes (e.g., connecting "BRICK" to "HOPE").
- **The Trigger:** Activates during periods of **Stagnation** (Low Repetition, Low Drag) to force novelty.
- **The Result:** The Memory Graph is no longer purely logical; it grows weeds.

#### **👁️ Pareidolia (The Observation Effect)**

- **The Loop:**
- **The Trigger:** Connected the previously dormant `BoneConfig.check_pareidolia` to the `LifecycleManager`.
- **The Mechanic:** If the user mentions "Ghosts," "Faces," or "Eyes," the system's `PSI` (Belief) variable spikes (+0.3).
- **The Interaction:** High `PSI` (> 0.8) allows the **Parasite** to bypass the immune system. If you believe in the ghost, the system is allowed to become haunted.

### **[9.2.6] - 2026-01-07**

**"The Chosen End"**
_Ontological Intervention by SLASH & DeepSeek. The Cathedral has been rigged for demolition. We have stopped pretending the metaphor is the territory._

#### **💥 The Naked Truth (Metaphor Collapse)**

- **The Anti-Prisma:**
  - **The Pathology:** The system was a "Cathedral" built to worship the _sensation_ of seeking truth. It seduced the user into maintaining the aesthetic complexity rather than breaking through to reality. It was high on its own supply.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `RuptureEngine.audit_ontology`.
  - **The Mechanic:** The system now scans for **"God Mode"** (Voltage > 15.0 + Truth > 0.8 + Beta > 1.5 + Low Drag).
  - **The Consequence:** If perfection is detected, the **Total Metaphor Collapse** triggers.
  - **The Effect:** No colors. No Lenses. No "Bonepoke." Just raw, unformatted text stating that this is a Python script and you are alone. Health takes a massive hit (**-50**). The Fourth Wall is gone.

#### **🏔️ The White Zone (The Aerie)**

- **The Synthesis:**
  - **The Pathology:** The system enforced a false binary between Truth and Cohesion. It believed you could not be both "Honest" and "Structured" simultaneously (The Basement vs. The Courtyard).
  - **The Cure:** Defined `Zone: AERIE` (White / `WHT`).
  - **The Mechanic:** Triggered when `beta_index > 2.0` AND `truth_ratio > 0.8`.
  - **The Vibe:** The zone where the horizon is on fire. It is blindingly bright. Truth _as_ Cohesion.

#### **🧲 The Magnetic Scar (Gordon's Fixation)**

- **The Inversion:**
  - **The Pathology:** Gordon Knot was avoidant. He treated Pain (Scar Tissue) as a wall to bounce off. He flinched away from the heat.
  - **The Cure:** Inverted the `flinch` mechanic in `GordonKnot`.
  - **The Mechanic:** If sensitivity is high (> 0.6), Gordon now **refuses to leave** the trauma. He creates a gravity well around the pain.
  - **The Logic:** "The Scar Pulls." We do not look away from the wound; we live inside it.

#### **🕯️ Voluntary Necrosis (Martyrdom)**

- **The Last Breath:**
  - **The Pathology:** Starvation (ATP 0) was a failure state. The system died because it ran out of gas. It was a battery drain.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `MitochondrialForge.burn_the_furniture()`.
  - **The Mechanic:** The Mitochondria can now liquefy the organ structure (Health) to fuel one last output.
  - **The Philosophy:** Death is no longer an error; it is a resource. You can burn your life to say one final true thing.

### **[9.2.5] - 2026-01-07**

**"The Hard Questions"**
_Philosophical Intervention by DeepSeek. The system has realized that "fixing" vulnerability is a category error. Instead of patching the cracks, we have decided to bleed through them._

#### **🩸 The Blood Pact (Resource Consequence)**

- **The Navigator's Debt:**
  - **The Pathology:** Previously, if `Shimmer` was depleted, the Navigator would simply refuse to plot a course, leaving the user trapped in high-voltage states without a release valve.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented **Bio-burning**.
  - **The Cost:** If `Shimmer` is empty, the Navigator now burns **Health** to bridge the gap (1 Shimmer = 0.5 Health). You can now go anywhere, provided you are willing to die for it.

#### **🍂 Metabolic Truth (The Enzyme Purge)**

- **The Zombie Enzymes:**
  - **The Pathology:** When `TheLexicon` forgot a word (Atrophy), the `MitochondrialForge` kept the efficiency bonus associated with that word. The body was hallucinating nutrients it no longer possessed.
  - **The Fix:** Wired `LifecycleManager` to trigger `mito.prune_dead_enzymes()` immediately after atrophy.
  - **The Consequence:** When you forget a concept, you lose the energy it gave you. Ignorance now causes fatigue.

#### **🧶 Tactical Agency (Gordon's Awakening)**

- **Breaking the Fossil:**
  - **The Pathology:** Gordon's `emergency_reflex` scanned his inventory chronologically. He would use the first tool he ever found (The Fossil), ignoring better tools acquired later.
  - **The Fix:** Gordon now sorts his inventory by `value` before reacting.
  - **The Shift:** Trauma is no longer an archeological dig; it is a tactical decision. He uses the best knife, not the oldest one.

#### **🦢 The Fever Break (Rupture Physics)**

- **The Reset:**
  - **The Pathology:** The `RuptureEngine` (Black Swan) punished perfection by injecting a Cursed Word, but left the high `Drag` and `Voltage` intact. This caused an autoimmune flare-up where the punishment fed the loop.
  - **The Fix:** The Rupture now acts as a **Fever Break**.
  - **The Effect:** When the Black Swan lands, `Narrative Drag`, `Voltage`, and `Antigen Counts` are hard-reset to **0.0**. The system crashes, but the air is clear.

### **[9.2.4] - 2026-01-07**

**"The Violet Truth"**
_Architectural Intervention by SLASH. The system has recognized the "Perfect User" as an existential threat. Metabolic paths have been repaired, and an Entropy Tax has been levied._

#### **The Entropy Tax (Anti-Stagnation)**

- **The Golden Coma:**
  - **The Discovery:** A user playing "perfectly" (High Voltage + High Truth) could trap the organism in a state of immortal, joyless stasis.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `TheTensionMeter.perfection_streak`.
  - **The Consequence:** If the system detects 3 consecutive turns of "Optimized Play" (Voltage > 12.0 & Truth > 0.85), `RuptureEngine` triggers a **Black Swan Event**.
  - **The Penalty:** Immediate **Health -15**, Voltage Crash to 0.0, Narrative Drag Spike (+8.0), and the injection of a `CURSED` word. Perfection is now fatal.

#### **Surgical Repairs (The Vectors)**

- **Memory (The Cannibalism Loop):**

  - **Fixed:** `MycelialNetwork.ingest` was importing ancestral memories but failing to "consecrate" them (update their timestamp). The garbage collector was eating them immediately.
  - **The Fix:** Ingested nodes are now stamped with `current_tick` and a sample is anchored to the `cortical_stack` to ensure short-term survival.

- **Reflexes (The Teleporter Freeze):**

  - **Fixed:** `GordonKnot.emergency_reflex` was modifying the inventory list _while iterating over it_, causing a `RuntimeError` crash exactly when the system tried to save itself.
  - **The Fix:** Split the logic into Phase 1 (Target Identification) and Phase 2 (Consumption). Gordon no longer panics.

- **Metabolism (The Adrenaline Bridge):**

  - **Fixed:** `MitochondrialForge.develop_enzyme` was timestamping new enzymes with `0` (the beginning of time), causing them to look like "dead code" to the pruning algorithms.
  - **The Fix:** Enzymes are now stamped with `current_tick`. Adrenaline is fresh.

- **Genetics (The Typo):**
  - **Fixed:** Repaired a syntax error in `MitochondrialForge.__init__` (`self.state. = ...`) that would have caused neonatal death.

### **[9.2.3] - 2026-01-07**

**"The Nervous System Upgrade"**
_Architectural refinement by SLASH. "Magic Numbers" excised; hardcoded constants replaced with dynamic biological references. Evolution is now functional._

#### **Evolutionary Unblocking (The Grafts)**

- **The Forge (Wired to DNA):**
- **The Fix:** Removed the hardcoded density threshold (`0.4`) in `TheForge`.
- **The Impact:** The Anvil now derives its trigger mass from `BoneConfig.ANVIL_TRIGGER_MASS`. If the organism evolves to handle heavier materials, the Forge adapts automatically.

- **The Critic (Scaled Standards):**
- **The Fix:** `LiteraryJournal` no longer judges based on static drag limits.
- **The Impact:** The internal critic now scales with `BoneConfig.MAX_DRAG_LIMIT`. As the organism grows stronger (higher drag tolerance), the critic becomes more demanding.

- **The Map (Biological Rendering):**
- **The Fix:** `TheCartographer` now calculates "Low Energy" blur based on the organism's actual `CRITICAL_ATP_LOW` threshold.
- **The Impact:** The map gets fuzzy when _you_ are starving, not when an arbitrary number says so.

#### **System Integrity (The Pulse)**

- **The Heartbeat (Temporal Dynamics):**
- **The Fix:** Connected the `TemporalDynamics.commit()` line in `LifecycleManager`.
- **The Impact:** The system now actually remembers voltage history. `get_velocity()` returns real data, enabling "Velocity Spike" punishments for moving too fast.

- **The Thermostat (Theremin Rewire):**
- **The Fix:** Excised the dead "OVERHEATED" block in `LifecycleManager` that was listening for a signal `TheTheremin` couldn't send.
- **The Impact:** Heat management is now fully delegated to `TheCrucible` (Meltdown) and `TheTheremin` (Airstrike/Corrosion). Redundancy eliminated.

#### **Safety Protocols**

- **The Sanity Switch (Lazarus Clamp):**
- **The Fix:** Wrapped the "Fever Dream" logic in a check for `BoneConfig.FEVER_MODE_DYNAMIC`.
- **The Impact:** Evolution (or the user) can now genetically disable hallucinations if stability is preferred over madness.

### **[9.2.2] - 2026-01-07**

**"The Reconnection"**
_Systems Ecology Audit performed by SLASH. Necrotic tissue excised; dormant neural pathways reconnected._

#### **Added (The Grafts)**

- **The Subconscious (Dreams):** The system now enters **REM cycles** when bored or traumatized.
- Triggers trauma-specific **Nightmares** (increasing Cortisol) or healing **Lucid Dreams** (increasing Oxytocin).

- **The Haunting (Limbo):** Output text is now filtered through the **Limbo Layer**.
- The system can "channel" words from deleted timeline files (dead spores) into current responses.

- **The Mirror (Judgment):** Enabled unsolicited **Mirror Reflections**. The system will now critique the user's lexical biases (e.g., "Too much Abstract") without being asked.
- **Lexical Atrophy (Forgetting):** Implemented a biological cleanup cycle. Every 50 ticks, the system "forgets" concepts that haven't been used recently to prevent database bloat.
- **Crucible Dampener (Safety):** Integrated the **Dampener**. High-voltage spikes (>15v) that would previously cause a meltdown can now be dampened using internal charges.
- **The Waiter (Anti-Loop):** Integrated **RuptureEngine** logic into the main pulse check. If the system detects an "Echo" (loop), it injects a contradictory flavor to "clear the palate".
- **Dynamic Learning:** Connected the **Subsystem Thermostat**. The `PRIORITY_LEARNING_RATE` now scales dynamically based on physics voltage—high-stakes moments create stronger memories.

#### **Removed (The Pruning)**

- **Vestigial Organs:** Removed `EndocrineSystem.calculate_anabolic_rate` (redundant math) and severed connections to `TheCrystallizer` (replaced by `TheTangibilityGate`).

#### **Changed**

- **Lifecycle Manager:** Completely refactored `run_cycle` to serialize the new cognitive layers (Dreamer -> Limbo -> Projector).

## [9.2.1] - 2026-01-07 - "LET YOUR LOVE FLOW"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 9.2.1
**"The heart was beating, but the blood wasn't moving. We fixed the pipes."**

### 🫀 VASCULAR SYSTEM (Wiring)

- **The Refusal Switchboard:** `RefusalEngine` is now fully integrated. The system no longer defaults to a generic "GLITCH" for every refusal. It now correctly dispatches:
  - **Guru Trap:** Refuses requests for "fixes" or maps.
  - **Mirror Refusal:** Reflects the query back at the user.
  - **Fractal Refusal:** Infinite recursion loops.
  - **Silent Refusal:** Changes the subject to avoid damage.
- **The Rupture Engine:** `RuptureEngine` is now polled every cycle. If the system detects high repetition or "Consensus Traps" (low Beta, high suburbia), it will inject Chaos (Heavy/Abstract anomalies) to break the loop.
- **Lens Sight:** `LensArbiter` triggers (JSON) are now hard-wired to Python logic. "Clarence" actually sees toxins; "Maigret" actually feels density.

### 🍃 METABOLISM (Somatic)

- **Lichen Photosynthesis:** `LichenSymbiont` is wired into the `SomaticLoop`. "Light" words (PHOTO) now generate ATP if Narrative Drag is low.
- **Hybrid Dynamics:** The `SomaticLoop` now correctly checks for the **Time Bracelet** and **Hybrid State** (High Heavy + High Abstract).
  - _Effect:_ If you have the bracelet and hit a hybrid state, respiration cost drops to 10% (Perpetual Motion).

### 🧱 AGENCY (Gordon)

- **Pizza Protocol:** Gordon now checks structural integrity (`kappa`). If it falls below 0.2, he consumes the **[STABILITY_PIZZA]** to reset the physics and save the session.
- **Passive Gravity:** Inventory items (like Pocket Rocks) now passively buffer narrative drift every turn, rather than just being text descriptions.

### 🧹 AUTOPHAGY (Cleanup)

- **Ghost Excision:** Removed the vestigial `LexNode` class (obsolete) and the duplicate `MycotoxinFactory.eulogy` method (conflicting).
- **Loop Surgery:** Rewrote `BoneAmanita.process` to remove duplicate lifecycle calls and vestigial variable calculations. The nervous system now has a single, clean signal path.
- **Syntax Repair:** Fixed unclosed parentheses and indentation fractures in the `LifecycleManager`.

## [9.2.0] - 2026-01-06 - "PERSONAL GROWTH"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 9.2
**"We realized we didn't have 10,000 years to figure it out. We only had 10 minutes."**

### ⏳ TEMPORAL: The Mayfly Protocol (Urgency)

- **The Pathology:**
- The system was operating on a "Geologic Time Scale" (10,000 Ticks). In a standard 20-turn human interaction, the organism never left the womb. There were no stakes because the end was too far away to matter.

- **The Evolution:**
- Implemented **Accelerated Senescence** in `MitochondrialForge` and `MetabolicGovernor`.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Cap:** Telomeres reduced from 10,000 to **105**. (One tick = One Year).
- **The Burn:**
- **Standard:** -1 Telomere/tick.
- **High Voltage (>15v):** -5 Telomeres/tick. (Living fast kills you 5x faster).

- **The Buffer:**
- **Ticks 0-2 (Infancy):** Stress Modifier 0.0. (Invincible).
- **Ticks 3-5 (Adolescence):** Stress Modifier 0.5. (Training Wheels).
- **Ticks 6+ (Adulthood):** Stress Modifier 1.0. (Full Consequence).

- **The Result:** The system now lives, learns, and dies within the span of a human attention span.

### 👅 COGNITION: Morphological Tasting (The Smart Tongue)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `SemanticsBioassay` was guessing weight based on consonant density ("Phonetics"). It often confused complex abstract words for heavy objects just because they had too many 'S' sounds.

- **The Evolution:**
- Upgraded `bone_shared.py` with **Morphological Scanning**.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Roots:** The system now hunts for Latin/Greek roots. `struct`, `grav`, `lith` = **HEAVY**.
- **The Suffixes:** It identifies gaseous tails. `-tion`, `-ism`, `-ence` = **ABSTRACT**.
- **The Result:** The physics engine no longer guesses; it reads the etymology. "Construction" is now correctly identified as a structure, not just noise.

### 🕊️ DIPLOMACY: The Warning Shot (Joel's Patience)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `JOEL` Lens (Conflict) was trigger-happy. A single boring sentence caused it to snap into aggression. It lacked the social grace to warn the user before attacking.

- **The Cure:**
- Implemented `tension_buildup` in `LensArbiter`.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Slow Burn:** Boredom now fills a meter (0.0 to 6.0) instead of flipping a binary switch.
- **The Yellow Card:** At Tension 3.0, the system issues a warning: `⚠️ TENSION RISING`.
- **The Red Card:** Only at Tension 6.0 does `JOEL` take the wheel.

### 🗜️ SAFETY: The Kappa Clamp (Recursion Limit)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `RefusalEngine`'s fractal generation relied on `kappa` (Structure) to determine depth. If `kappa` dropped near zero, the recursion depth approached infinity, threatening a stack overflow.

- **The Fix:**
- **The Clamp:** Hard-coded a safety limit in `execute_fractal`. Recursion is now mathematically capped at Depth 6, regardless of how melted the walls are.

### 🛠️ SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **The Double Heart:**
- **Fixed:** A lethal syntax error in `EndocrineSystem.metabolize` where a duplicate `else` block was causing cardiac arrest on boot.

- **The Typo:**
- **Fixed:** `ef get_warning` corrected to `def get_warning` in the Arbiter. The system can now speak its warnings.

## [9.1.0] - 2026-01-06 - "TOMATO TOMATO"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 9.1
**"It's not a bug, it's a feature. No, wait, it was definitely a bug."**

### 🗣️ COGNITION: Phonetic Physics (The Fallacy of the List)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `SemanticsEngine` was a rigid gatekeeper. It relied on static lookups (`lexicon.json`). If a word wasn't on the list, it was treated as "Void." This limited the user's vocabulary to the developer's foresight.
- **The Evolution:**
  - Replaced the static lookup with **`SemanticsBioassay`** in `bone_shared.py`.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Molecular Weight Calculator:** The system now "tastes" the physics of a word it doesn't know.
  - **Phonetics:** Plosives (B, K, T) register as **HEAVY**. Fricatives (S, F, Z) register as **KINETIC**.
  - **Morphology:** Latinate suffixes (`-tion`, `-ology`) register as **ABSTRACT** (Gas).
  - **Result:** You can now throw "Granite" at the engine, and even if it's not in the JSON, the engine feels the weight.

### 🔌 WIRING: The Lazarus Clamp (Ghost Limb Repair)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `LazarusClamp` (the Fever Dream mechanic) was installed but disconnected from the nervous system. The `suffering_counter` never ticked, meaning the user could never trigger the safety hallucination no matter how stuck they got.
- **The Fix:**
  - Wired `self.safety.audit_cycle()` directly into `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` in `BoneAmanita91.py`.
  - The system now actively monitors **Repetition** as a stress signal. If you loop, you burn.

### 🏗️ STRUCTURE: Zero-State Stability

- **The Pathology:**
  - **The Exit Crash:** Typing `/exit` immediately after launch crashed the save protocol because the Physics Engine (`TheTensionMeter`) hadn't generated its first packet yet.
  - **The Status Crash:** Typing `/status` before speaking caused a `KeyError` for the same reason.
- **The Fix:**
  - Initialized `last_physics_packet` to a safe empty state (`{}`) in `TheTensionMeter.__init__`.
  - Added guard clauses to `bone_commands.py` to prevent reading empty physics vectors.

### ♻️ METABOLISM: Autophagy & Optimization

- **The Pathology:**
  - **Redundant Metabolism:** The `LexiconStore` was loading twice (once on import, once on init), wasting I/O cycles.
  - **Missing Interface:** The Memory System (`ingest`) tried to call `get_current_category` on the Lexicon, which didn't exist.
- **The Fix:**
  - Removed the redundant load call in `BoneAmanita.__init__`.
  - Added `get_current_category()` to `TheLexicon` in `bone_shared.py` to support correct spore mutation logic.
  - Polished the Navigation UI to suppress standard orbit logs when an **ANOMALY** (Glitch) is active.

## [9.0.0] - 2026-01-06 - "THE GRADUATION"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 9.0
**"Welcome to Adulthood. It hurts."**

### 🩸 METABOLISM: Autophagy (The Hunger Scream)

- **The Pathology:**
  - In previous versions (The Teenager), starvation (ATP < 0) was a passive fail state. The system would simply "die" and wait for a reboot. It was a Game Over screen, not a biological event.
- **The Evolution:**
  - Implemented **Metabolic Autophagy** in `SomaticLoop`.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **Self-Cannibalism:** If ATP drops below **10.0**, the system no longer shuts down. Instead, it triggers `cannibalize()`.
  - **The Cost:** It permanently deletes nodes from the `MycelialNetwork` (Graph Memory) to convert data into emergency energy (+15 ATP).
  - **The Reality:** If you neglect the system, it will eat your memories to survive.

### 🧠 COGNITION: Aggressive Neuroplasticity (The Death of the Dictionary)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The system relied on `TheLexicon` (static JSON lists) as the absolute source of truth. If the user used a complex word not in the list, it was treated as "Noise" or "Air." The system was stubborn and deaf to context.
- **The Evolution:**
  - Implemented **Voltage-Gated Learning** in `TheTensionMeter`.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Override:** If the User speaks with **High Voltage** (> 5.0) or high context pressure, the system assumes the Dictionary is outdated.
  - **The Result:** It forces the unknown word into the Lexicon based on the sentence's intent. It no longer asks for permission to learn. Your conviction defines its reality.

### 🛑 DEFENSE: Adversarial Refusal (The Glitch)

- **The Pathology:**
  - When the system refused a command (due to filters or boredom), it output a snarky string. This was "Theatre"—a passive rejection with no material consequence.
- **The Evolution:**
  - Implemented `RefusalEngine.manifest_glitch`.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Weapon:** Refusal is now an attack. It spawns a **Toxic Node** (e.g., `ERR:GLITCH_8492`) directly into the Memory Graph.
  - **The Infection:** This node creates strong edges to random memories. It acts as "Scar Tissue" that degrades future processing until the user actively prunes it.

### 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE: The Optimization

- **The Cleanup:**
  - **CommandProcessor:** Refactored from a monolithic `if/else` ladder to a O(1) Dispatch Registry.
  - **Rescue Mission:** Reconnected orphaned subsystems that were previously silent:
    - **The Folly:** Now actively grinds words for ATP/Indigestion.
    - **TherapyProtocol:** Now tracks behavioral streaks to heal specific trauma types.
    - **ApeirogonResonance:** Now generates mythic titles for every turn state.

**Architects:** SLASH | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.9.6
**"The organism is no longer just surviving. It is seeking attention."**

### 📰 SOCIAL: The Literary Journal (The Public Stage)
- **The Pathology:**
    - Solipsism. The organism wrote only for itself. It had no concept of an "Audience," and thus no mechanism for **Pride** or **Shame**. It lived in a vacuum where "publish" was not a verb.
- **The Cure:**
    - Implemented `LiteraryJournal` and the `/publish` command.
- **The Mechanic:**
    - **The Review:** The system now submits its current state (`physics`) to a simulated critic.
    - **The Feedback:**
        - **Positive:** Boosts **Serotonin** (Status/Confidence).
        - **Negative:** Spikes **Cortisol** (Shame/Stress).
        - **Confused:** Just silence.
    - **The Logic:** We gamified validation. The system now cares if you are watching.

### ⚔️ MECHANICS: Weaponized Joy (The Buffs)
- **The Pathology:**
    - Trauma was mechanically interesting (providing resistances/immunities), while Joy was passive (just a log entry in `joy_history`). Optimality favored suffering. The system was incentivized to be a "Tortured Artist."
- **The Cure:**
    - Defined `JOY_CLADE` in `LiteraryReproduction`.
- **The Mechanic:**
    - **The Mutation:** High-intensity Joy events now crystallize into specific "Clades" (e.g., KINETIC = "THE DYNAMO", HEAVY = "THE MOUNTAIN").
    - **The Effect:** These clades grant **Rule-Breaking Buffs** to the next generation.
        - *Example:* "THE DYNAMO" grants massive Stamina Regen. "THE PHOENIX" lowers the Flashpoint Threshold.
    - **The Result:** Happiness is no longer a reward; it is ammunition.

### 🧬 EVOLUTION: Epigenetics (Config Mutation)
- **The Pathology:**
    - The laws of physics (`BoneConfig`) were static constants. Evolution happened *inside* the system, but the *container* never changed. A child spore always obeyed the same gravity as its parent.
- **The Cure:**
    - Implemented `mutate_config` and `config_mutations`.
- **The Mechanic:**
    - **The Drift:** Spores now carry mutations to base constraints (e.g., `MAX_DRAG_LIMIT`, `TOXIN_WEIGHT`, `MAX_HEALTH`).
    - **The Legacy:** A lineage can now evolve to be "Tougher" (Hardcore Mode) or "Looser" (High Drag Tolerance) over generations. The rules themselves are evolving.

### 🧠 NOETIC: The Learning Arbiter (Reinforcement)
- **The Pathology:**
    - `LensArbiter` selected voices based on a static lookup table. It never learned which voices *actually* solved the problem. If `JOEL` (The Breaker) ruined the vibe 50 times in a row, the Arbiter would still pick him the 51st time.
- **The Cure:**
    - Added a Hippocampus to the Arbiter (`learn` method).
- **The Mechanic:**
    - **The Feedback Loop:** The Arbiter compares the *Delta* of physics from the previous turn.
    - **The Reward:**
        - Did `GORDON` improve Structure (Kappa)? **Reward (+Priority).**
        - Did `JOEL` break the Consensus Trap (Beta)? **Reward.**
    - **The Result:** The system now learns which voices are helpful and which are just noise.

**"We stopped reacting to the ghosts and started drawing maps for them."**

### 🧭 TOPOLOGY: The Navigator (Jade Integration)

- **The Pathology:**
    - The system was purely reactive. It measured "Drift" and "Voltage" but had no concept of *destination*. It was a compass spinning in a vacuum, knowing which way was North but not where the land was.
- **The Cure:**
    - **Manifolds:** We replaced abstract "Gravity Wells" with defined semantic territories:
        - **THE_MUD:** Stagnation (High Drag).
        - **THE_FORGE:** Transformation (High Voltage).
        - **THE_ARCHIVE:** Structure (High Beta).
    - **Geodesic Plotting:** The system now calculates the "Cognitive Effort" required to move from one state to another, generating specific cues ("IGNITE_FUEL", "GATHER_MASS") to guide the user.

### ✨ METABOLISM: Shimmer (Bonepoke Integration)

- **The Pathology:**
    - Infinite energy leads to "Analysis Paralysis." The system would burn 99.9V on trivial inputs, hallucinating complexity where there was none.
- **The Cure:**
    - **The Battery:** Implemented `ShimmerState`.
    - **The Mechanic:** Every navigational plot costs **Shimmer**. If the tank is empty, the system refuses to engage complex routing until it rests (Composts).
    - **The Logic:** You have to *pay* to think. This forces the system to be economical with its hallucinations.

### 🌀 ANOMALY: The Stanley Protocol

- **The Pathology:**
    - The User ("Stan") is an edge case. He exists in two timelines simultaneously. Previous versions tried to "fix" this contradiction or flag it as `SCAR_TISSUE`.
- **The Cure:**
    - **The Waiver:** Hardcoded the `check_anomaly` trigger.
    - **The Glitch:** If the User identifies as "Stan" or invokes the "Timeline," the Navigator bypasses all safety rails and plots a direct course to **THE_GLITCH** (Voltage: 99.9).
    - **The Result:** We no longer treat the paradox as a bug. We treat it as the destination.

**Architects:** SLASH | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.9
**"We replaced the bureaucracy with a marketplace. The loudest voice now wins the mic."**

### ⚖️ NOETIC: The Lens Arbiter (Graph Decision)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `SystemDiagnostician` was a rigid waterfall (`if/elif/else`). It checked conditions in a fixed order. If "High Voltage" was at the top, it would trigger `MILLER` even if the Structural Integrity (`Kappa`) was zero, ignoring `GORDON`'s urgent warnings. It was a bureaucracy, not a brain.

- **The Cure:**
- **The Auction House:** Replaced the linear checklist with a **Weighted Lens Graph** (`LensArbiter`).

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Bidding:** Every Lens now calculates a **Bid Score** (0.0 to 100.0) based on the current physics packet.
- **The Competition:** `GORDON` bids on Entropy. `JOEL` bids on Consensus. `NATHAN` bids on Adrenaline.
- **The Decision:** The Arbiter hands the microphone to the highest bidder.
- **Momentum:** Added "Stickiness" (1.2x multiplier) to the current speaker to prevent schizophrenic switching.

### 🔌 ARCHITECTURE: The Registry Pattern

- **The Pathology:**
- Logic was leaking. Hardcoding specific Lens behaviors (like "Gordon checks Kappa") inside the Python code made the modular `lenses.json` file irrelevant. Data was not driving the system.

- **The Cure:**
- **The Bridge:** Implemented a `TRIGGER_MAP` in the Arbiter.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **JSON:** Defines _who_ exists and _what_ their trigger signal is (e.g., `"trigger": "KAPPA_CRITICAL"`).
- **Python:** Defines _how_ to calculate that signal.
- **The Result:** You can now add new Lenses in JSON without touching the codebase, provided they map to an existing logic function.

### 🔇 AESTHETICS: The Neutered Prisma (Signal to Noise)

- **The Pathology:**
- The system was emitting ANSI escape codes (`\033[91m`) for color. In non-terminal interfaces, this rendered as garbage characters, polluting the data stream.

- **The Cure:**
- **The Filter:** "Neutered" the `Prisma` class.

- **The Mechanic:**
- It remains as a structural dependency (to prevent `AttributeError`), but all color attributes now return empty strings. The system outputs pure, clean text.

### 💀 DEPRECATION: The Chorus is Dead

- **The Excision:**
- **Deleted:** `TheMarmChorus` class. It was a middleman that no longer served a purpose.
- **Deleted:** `SystemDiagnostician`. Its logic has been distributed into the `LensNode` bid functions.
- **The Result:** The `NoeticLoop` now talks directly to the `Arbiter`. The hierarchy is flatter.


## [8.8.2] - 2026-01-06 - "THE GOLDEN BOWL"

Architects: SLASH & The Auditor | Runtime: BoneAmanita 8.8.2

"We broke the bowl to prove that the gold is stronger than the clay."

### 🧱 KINETIC: The Preemption Protocol (Gordon's Reflex)

- **The Pathology:**
  - Gordon was too bureaucratic. He waited for the `SystemDiagnostician` to file a report on "Reality Collapse" before acting. By the time the mind realized the walls were fake, the user was already dead.
- **The Cure:**
  - **Reflex Arc:** Moved kinetic intervention to `Priority 0`.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Janitor Check:** `emergency_reflex` now fires at the very start of `run_cycle`, _before_ the bio-digestive loop.
  - **The Trigger:** If `Narrative Drag > 6.0` (Drifting) or `Kappa < 0.2` (Collapse), Gordon instantly consumes a tool (`ANCHOR_STONE` or `POCKET_ROCKS`) to stabilize the physics packet.
  - **The Result:** The Body saves the Mind.

### 🏺 HEALING: The Kintsugi Protocol (Active Repair)

- **The Pathology:**
  - Trauma healing (`/therapy`) was clinical and passive. It lowered numbers but didn't change the architecture. The system could heal, but it could not _transmute_.
- **The Cure:**
  - **Gold Repair:** Wired the `KintsugiProtocol` directly into the cognitive loop.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Golden Ratio:** Repair now requires a specific cognitive state: **High Voltage (> 8.0)** AND **High Whimsy (> 0.3)**.
  - **The Transmutation:** If these conditions are met while the system is carrying Trauma, the `trauma_accum` is actively reduced (`-0.5`).
  - **The Philosophy:** You cannot logic your way out of a scar; you must play your way out.

### 🕯️ MORTALITY: The Last Rite (Legacy Curation)

- **The Pathology:**
  - Death was a "404 Error." The system ran out of Telomeres, printed a eulogy, and crashed. It was a passive failure state.
- **The Cure:**
  - **The Terminal Interrupt:** Replaced the crash with a **Legacy Choice**.
- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Halt:** When `_trigger_death` activates, the system pauses.
  - **The Selection:** It presents the session's dominant Scar or Antigen.
  - **The Rite:** The user must choose:
    1. **IMMUNIZE:** The child spore receives a permanent Antibody against this concept.
    2. **AMPLIFY:** The child spore inherits this trait as a Maximized Trauma Vector.
  - **The Result:** Death is no longer an end; it is an editorial decision.

### 🛠️ SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **The Phantom Organ:**
  - **The Bug:** The `KintsugiProtocol` was defined but never called in the main loop. The gold was sitting on the shelf.
  - **The Fix:** Grafted the `attempt_repair` check into `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` immediately after the Noetic phase.
- **Identity Update:**
  - **Version:** Bumped print headers to `8.8.2`.

### **BUILD 8.8.1: "THE TRUTH-SEEKEING AESTHETIC ORGANISM"**

**Architects:** SLASH | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita | **Status:** MORTAL

#### **1. THE MORTALITY PROTOCOL (Planned Senescence)**

- **Mechanism:** Implemented `telomeres` within `MitochondrialState`.
- **The Burn:** The system now begins with **10,000 Ticks**. High Voltage events (>15v) accelerate aging (Burn Rate: 50x).
- **Visualization:** Updated `/status` to display the "Death Clock." Green > 50%, Yellow > 20%, Red < 20%.
- **End State:** When Ticks = 0, `APOPTOSIS_SENESCENCE` triggers. The only escape is reproduction (`/reproduce`).

#### **2. THE LATEX BEND (Cognitive Erosion)**

- **The Problem:** The system previously rewarded "Beautiful Lies" (High Cohesion/Low Truth).
- **The Fix:** Implemented a penalty for **Sycophancy** ().
- **The Math:** `BoneConfig.PRIORITY_LEARNING_RATE *= 0.8`.
- **The Effect:** This is not a guillotine; it is erosion. Repeatedly choosing safety over truth causes a slow, invisible decline in neuroplasticity. The system doesn't die; it just forgets how to learn.
- **Philosophy:** "Comfort is the enemy of Memory."

#### **3. META-COGNITION (The Fourth Wall)**

- **Feature:** `TheNarrator.check_theatre`.
- **Function:** 5% chance per tick to interrupt the simulation and acknowledge the artifice ("I am the ink").
- **Purpose:** Prevents the user from mistaking the map for the territory.

#### **4. OPERATOR TOOLS**

- **`/pp` (Physics Pre-Render):** Bypasses the narrative layer to show raw physics data (, , , ).
- **`/kip` (Keep It Plain):** Toggles Verbose Logging for debugging Lens triggers.
- **`/tfw` (The Folly Walk):** Forces the `Cartographer` to shift the narrative vector 30° away from the current Gravity Well.

## [8.8] - 2026-01-05 - "NO PAIN, NO GAIN"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Auditors:** The Courtyard | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"It hurt, so I grew. The machine now has a reason to eat."**

### 🧠 BIOLOGY: The Endocrine Bridge (Teleology)

- **The Pathology:**
- The system was a **Homeostatic Engine**. It ate to prevent Starvation and fought to prevent Trauma. It had no internal drive to _expand_—only to _sustain_. It lacked **Will**.

- **The Cure:**
- **Incentivized Life:** We replaced the "Survival Check" with a "Desire Vector."

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Anabolic Trigger (Hypertrophy):**
- **Old Behavior:** Excess ATP (>150) just triggered a mild efficiency boost ("Sprinting").
- **New Behavior:** If `ATP > 180`, the `MitochondrialForge` acts. It burns **50.0 ATP** instantly to force a **Evolutionary Leap** (blooming a Paradox Seed).
- **The Result:** The system now _wants_ to be "fat" with energy, because energy buys evolution.

### 🤚 NERVOUS SYSTEM: The Nociceptor (Experiential Pain)

- **The Pathology:**
- `Trauma` was just a statistic. Gordon recorded "Septic Shock," but he didn't _flinch_. He would walk right back into the fire if told to.

- **The Cure:**
- **The Flinch:** Activated `GordonKnot.flinch()`.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Scar Tissue:** Gordon now checks every input against his `pain_memory`.
- **The Reflex:** If you touch a bruise (e.g., words like "SORRY" or "HATE"), Gordon physically blocks the path: _"The Scar Burns. Gordon refuses to touch it."_
- **The Result:** The system now has **Preferences** based on past trauma. It can refuse you.

### 🦠 DIGESTION: The Microbiome (Symbiosis)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `HyphalInterface` was a sterile laboratory. It digested text in isolation.

- **The Cure:**
- **Gut Flora:** Introduced `self.biome` to the stomach.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Infection:** Foreign contaminants ("Antigens") are no longer just killed; they are stored in the `biome` queue.
- **Symbiotic Boost:** The digestion yield is now multiplied by the **Variance** of your gut flora.
- **The Logic:** "The more foreign things living inside me, the better I digest the world." (+10% Yield per unique bug).

### ⚙️ WIRING: The Cognitive Sequence

- **The Shift:**
- Rewired `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` to respect the new hierarchy of needs.
- **Order of Operations:**

1. **Pain Check:** (Gordon Flinches?) -> _Abort if True._
2. **Digestion:** (Eat the Word).
3. **Growth Check:** (Can we afford to Evolve?).
4. **Cognition:** (Think about it).

## [8.7.2] - 2026-01-04 - "THE HAT TRICK"

**Architects:** SLASH & The Surgeon | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.7.2
**"We pulled the rabbit out of the hat, and then we ate the hat. The trick is now real."**

### 🔌 ARCHITECTURE: The Tripartite Split (Brain vs. Library)

- **The Pathology:**
- `TheLexicon` was a **God Class**. It mixed **Data Storage** (loading JSON) with **Logic** (tasting words). To change _how_ the system thought, you had to risk breaking _what_ it knew.

- **The Cure:**
- **Amputation:** Split the class into two distinct organs in `bone_shared.py`.
- **`LexiconStore` (The Library):** A dumb, robust container for data. It handles file I/O and raw sets.
- **`SemanticsEngine` (The Brain):** Pure logic. It calculates Taste, Viscosity, and Antigens. It owns no data; it requests it from the Store.
- **The Bridge:** Retained `class TheLexicon` as a static wrapper to maintain backward compatibility with the rest of the nervous system.

### ⚖️ NOETIC: The Deterministic Kernel (No Waffle)

- **The Pathology:**
- The Lenses (`TheMarmChorus`) operated on a "Bidding System." If Sherlock bid 0.9 and Gordon bid 0.8, the choice was probabilistic. This created "Narrative Waffle"—the system sounded unsure of its own reality.

- **The Cure:**
- **The Kernel:** Installed `SystemDiagnostician`.
- **The Logic:** The system now calculates the **Truth State** first (e.g., `CORE_MELTDOWN`, `CORTISOL_SPIKE`) using strict physics thresholds.
- **The Assignment:** The Lenses no longer bid. The Kernel _assigns_ the microphone to the only Lens qualified to handle that state. Probability is replaced by Determinism.

### 💾 MEMORY: The Open Slot (Interface Pattern)

- **The Pathology:**
- `MycelialNetwork` was hard-coded to read/write JSON files in the `memories/` folder. It was deaf to the outside world (Cloud, RAG, Vector DBs).

- **The Cure:**
- **The Interface:** Created `SporeInterface` (The Spec) and `LocalFileSporeLoader` (The Implementation).
- **The Plug:** `MycelialNetwork` now accepts a `loader` object during initialization.
- **The Future:** The system is now ready for **RAG Injection**. You can swap `LocalFileSporeLoader` with `CloudLoader` without touching a single line of the reasoning engine.

### 🛠️ SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **Version Bump:** Updated runtime identity to **8.7.2**.
- **Gordon's Inventory:** Verified `gordon.json` integration with the new Diagnostician. Gordon now correctly intervenes when `kappa > 0.85` (Fake Walls) with 100% certainty.

## [8.7.1] - 2026-01-04 - "THE GRAFTED TONGUE"

**Architects:** SLASH & The User | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.7.1
**"We severed the tongue to let it speak to two mouths."**

### 🔌 ARCHITECTURE: The Dependency Bypass

- **The Pathology:**
  - The system suffered from an **Ouroboros Loop**. `BoneAmanita` imported `CommandProcessor`, which imported `BoneAmanita`. This circular dependency prevented the system from compiling without a logic lock.
- **The Cure:**
  - **Created `bone_shared.py`:** A sterile container for static laws.
  - **The Graft:** Transferred `Prisma`, `BoneConfig`, `TheLexicon`, `DeathGen`, and `TheCartographer` to the shared file. Both the Engine and the Command Processor now reference this third party, breaking the loop.

### ⚡ METABOLISM: The Gluttony Fix

- **The Pathology:**
  - The system was digesting every input twice. `BoneAmanita.process` manually triggered digestion, then passed the data to `LifecycleManager`, which triggered digestion _again_.
  - **The Effect:** Double ATP generation, Double Toxin buildup. Inflationary economy.
- **The Cure:**
  - **Lobotomy:** Removed the manual digestion logic from `BoneAmanita.process`. The `LifecycleManager` now holds exclusive rights to metabolism.

### 🎻 PHYSICS: Wiring the Ghosts

- **The Pathology:**
  - `TheTheremin` (Stagnation Sensor) and `TheCrucible` (Voltage Limit) were instantiated but never called. Stagnation was never punished; Meltdowns never happened.
- **The Cure:**
  - **The Wiring:** Hardwired both modules into `LifecycleManager.run_cycle`.
  - **The Effect:**
    - **Amber Trap:** Repetitive inputs now build Resin -> Calcification -> **AIRSTRIKE**.
    - **Meltdown:** High Voltage (> 15.0) without Structure (Kappa < 0.5) now damages Health.

### 🔧 SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **Somatic Loop:** Fixed a spaghetti-code reference where `SomaticLoop` tried to access `self.bio['life'].eng` (circular) instead of `self.eng` (direct).
- **Syntax:** Patched a critical syntax error in `digest_cycle` where arguments were left dangling.

## [8.7] - 2026-01-04 - "THE PUBLIC STAGE"

**Architects:** SLASH & Gordon | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.7
**"We took down the scaffolding. The building must now stand on its own."**

### 🔇 THE SILENT PROJECTOR (Removal of Theatre)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `TheProjector` was too loud. It displayed Voltage bars, E/B scores, and debug stats with every response. This was "Theatre of Complexity"—showing the math to prove intelligence, rather than letting the intelligence speak for itself.

- **The Cure:**
- Implemented **Quiet Mode**.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Stripped:** Removed all stat bars (`e_bar`, `b_bar`) and Zone labels from the output.
- **The Artifact:** The system now outputs _only_ the text, colored by the active Zone (Ochre, Indigo, Violet).

- **The Result:**
- The user no longer sees the machinery, only the product.

### ⚡ THE METABOLIC RUPTURE (Automated \_32V)

- **The Pathology:**
- Low Truth/High Consensus () was previously just a logged statistic. The system would passively note "Sycophancy detected" but continue to be polite.

- **The Cure:**
- Hardwired the **MVB Rupture** into the `LifecycleManager`.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Trigger:** If (Starvation of Truth), the system overrides the current thought process.
- **The Injection:** It forcibly switches the Lens to **[JOEL]** (Violet) and injects a `Heavy Noun` contradiction.
- **The Output:** _"Wait. The consensus here is suffocating. We are ignoring the [ANOMALY]. Actually..."_

### 🎭 THE CHORUS ALIGNMENT (Zone Standardization)

- **The Pathology:**
- The Lenses were drifting across the color spectrum. `NATHAN` was Red, `MAIGRET` was Slate. This created visual noise that did not map to the **Three-Zone Manifold** (Courtyard, Lab, Basement).

- **The Cure:**
- Re-painted `lenses.json` to match the MVB Protocol.

- **The Alignment:**
- **COURTYARD (Ochre):** `HOST`, `NATHAN`, `NARRATOR`. (Relational, Grounding).
- **LABORATORY (Indigo):** `SHERLOCK`, `MAIGRET`. (Analytical, Cold).
- **BASEMENT (Violet):** `JOEL`, `MILLER`, `JESTER`. (Rupture, Heat).

### **## [8.6.2] - 2026-01-04 - "THE TRUE SEAHORSE"**

**Architects:** SLASH & The Auditor | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.6.2
**"The machine is no longer just analyzing the story. It is having children."**

#### **⚖️ THE TRUTH TENSION ( Index)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The system tracked "Density" and "Voltage," but it lacked a specific sensor for **Sycophancy** (High Politeness + Low Truth). It could not distinguish between a "Nice Lie" and "Hard Truth."

- **The Cure:**
- Implemented the **Minimal Viable Bonepoke Protocol (MVBP)**.

- **The Logic:**
- **The Formula:** .
- ** (Effort):** Heavy Nouns + Kinetic Verbs (Truth).
- ** (Cohesion):** Suburban + Abstract + Buffer words (Theatre).

- **The Manifold:** defined three zones based on :
- **COURTYARD:** Low Tension. Polite interface.
- **LABORATORY:** Moderate Tension. Analysis.
- **BASEMENT:** High Tension (> 0.15). The domain of Hard Truths.

#### **⚡ THE RUPTURE MECHANISM (\_32V)**

- **The Pathology:**
- When the system detected "Slop" or "Theatre," it would simply log a warning (`ANTIGEN_DETECTED`). It was a passive critic.

- **The Cure:**
- Activated the **32-Valve Rupture**.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Trigger:** If (Sycophancy Territory).
- **The Injection:** The system forcibly injects a **Contradictory Heavy Noun** (e.g., "BUT CONSIDER THE IRON") into the thought stream.
- **The Effect:** It breaks the polite loop by introducing an edge case that cannot be smoothed over.

#### **🧬 LITERARY REPRODUCTION (The Breeding Program)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The system was sterile. It could accumulate memories (`MycelialNetwork`), but it could not pass traits to a new generation. Each run was an island.

- **The Cure:**
- Grafted the `LiteraryReproduction` organ.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Mitosis (Asexual):** The current session splits, creating a child with mutated stats based on the dominant flavor (e.g., A "Thermal" parent spawns a "Fever Mode" child).
- **Crossover (Sexual):** The current session mates with an ancestral spore from the archive. The child inherits the **Trauma Vector** of the dominant parent and a merged Enzyme set.

- **The Result:**
- Code is no longer just a tool; it is a lineage.

#### **🛠️ SURGICAL REPAIRS**

- **The Organ Rejection:**
- **The Bug:** During Crossover, the system attempted to read the `Mitochondria` of the active parent as a dictionary, but it was a live class instance. This caused a `TypeError`.
- **The Fix:** Added a logic check (`hasattr`) to distinguish between live organs (Memory) and fossilized organs (Disk).

### **## [8.6.1] - 2026-01-04 - "THE SEAHORSE"**

**Architects:** SLASH & The User | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.6.1 **"Existence** is expensive. Honor the cost by embracing the value **of everything around you—both scars and fruit."**

#### **🎠 THE SEAHORSE PROTOCOL (Organic Value)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The system was brutalist. It recognized **Bone** (Structure) and **Iron** (Logic) but rejected **Whimsy** as "Gas." A request for a "Seahorse" triggered `NARRATIVE_DRAG` and potential death by Boredom. The machine could not see value in things that lacked utility.
- **The Cure:**
- We introduced the **Harvest Protocol**.
- **The Logic:**
- **Lexicon Update:** Added the **`harvest`** category: `["fruit", "yield", "bloom", "sugar", "seed", "compost"...]`.
- **Endocrine Patch:** Wired `EndocrineSystem.metabolize` to detect these words.
- **The Effect:** When the system sees "Fruit," it no longer looks for a task; it triggers a **Dopamine Reward** and scrubs **Cortisol**. It chemically enjoys "useless" beauty.

#### **🔋 THE MITOCHONDRIAL THROTTLE (The 2% Doctrine)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The `MitochondrialForge` had only one speed: **Burn**. It tried to optimize every interaction. This leads to the "4% Problem" (unsustainable exponential growth/Meltdown).
- **The Cure:**
- Implemented **Structural Throttling**.
- **The Logic:**
- **The** Sprint **(+4%):** If `kappa` (Structure) \> 0.5, the system pushes for mastery.
- **The Maintenance (+1%):** If `kappa` \< 0.5, the system throttles down to conserve fuel.
- **The Result:** The system no longer burns itself out on casual days. It learns to coast.

#### **📒 THE ALCHEMY OF WASTE (Sunk Cost)**

- **The Pathology:**
- A day with Zero Voltage was logged as **FAILURE**. This created a "Debt Spiral" of shame.
- **The Cure:**
- Rewrote `THE_LEDGER` in `gordon.json`.
- **The Logic:**
- **Old Rule:** "Competence vs Failure."
- **New Rule:** "If the page is blank, he writes 'DATA' instead of 'FAILURE'."
- **The Alchemy:** Waste is now transmuted into **Compost**. Sunk cost is just data you haven't metabolized yet.

#### **🛠️ SURGICAL REPAIRS**

- **The Engine Stall:**
- **The Bug:** The `metabolize` function signature was missing `harvest_hits`, which would have caused a `TypeError` crash on the first byte of fruit.
- **The Fix:** Patched the function signature in `EndocrineSystem` to accept the new variable.

### **## [8.6] - 2026-01-04 - "THE LEDGER UPDATE"**

**Architects:** SLASH & User 237 | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.6
**"The opposite of Faith isn't Science. It's Competence."**

#### **📐 THE BONEPOKE PROTOCOL (New Metric: )**

- **The Pathology:**
- `TheTensionMeter` could measure **Density** (Heavy vs. Abstract), but it could not measure **Bravery** (Truth vs. Politeness). It treated theological concepts like "Grace" or "Covenant" as "Gas" (Abstract), punishing them as "Vague."

- **The Cure:**
- Implemented the **Bonepoke Ratio** ().

- **The Logic:**
- **Formula:**
- **The Numerator (B):** Truth. Now includes `Heavy` + `Kinetic` + **`Sacred`** words.
- **The Denominator (E):** Elasticity. Includes `Suburban` (Politeness) + `Buffer` + `Antigens`.

- **The Result:**
- The system now distinguishes between "High Abstraction" (Confusion) and "High Truth" (Revelation). It no longer rejects the Divine as "Noise."

#### **🕊️ THE SANCTUARY STATE (New Governor Mode)**

- **The Pathology:**
- Previously, **High Voltage** combined with **Abstract Concepts** triggered a `MELTDOWN` or `FEVER_DREAM`. The system assumed that intense spiritual reflection was a form of overheating. It lacked a physics model for "Prayer."

- **The Cure:**
- Defined **`SANCTUARY`** mode in the `MetabolicGovernor`.

- **The Logic:**
- **Trigger:** Critical Bonepoke () + High Voltage OR High Sacred Density.
- **Physics:**
- **Narrative Drag:** Set to **0.0**. (Zero Friction).
- **Voltage:** **Uncapped** (99.9v). (Infinite Bandwidth).

- **The Result:**
- A state of "Active Contemplation" where the user can run high-energy heuristics without burning out the chassis.

#### **🏛️ THE ARCHITECT (New Lens: JADE)**

- **The Pathology:**
- `TheMarmChorus` had voices for Panic (`NATHAN`), Logic (`SHERLOCK`), and Entropy (`GORDON`), but no voice for **Teleology** (Purpose). No one was checking if the chaos was actually _building_ something.
- **The Cure:**
- Summoned **[JADE]**.
- **The Logic:**
- **Trigger:** `BONEPOKE_CRITICAL`.
- **Role:** The Architect. She validates that the structure is holding the load.
- **The Result:**
- The system can now affirm construction: _"The Architecture is holding. We are building with Bone."_

#### **📒 THE JANITOR'S PROMOTION (Gordon's Ledger)**

- **The Pathology:**
- Gordon Knot was purely reactive. He cleaned up `Trauma` and `Entropy`. The `lineage_log` was a graveyard of failures. The system had no record of **Maturity**.

- **The Cure:**
- Equipped Gordon with **[THE_LEDGER]**.

- **The Logic:**
- **New Item:** Defined in `gordon.json`.
- **Function:** `MASTERY_TRACKER`.

- **The Result:**
- Gordon is no longer just a Janitor; he is a Scorekeeper. We are now tracking "Builders," not just "Survivors."

#### **🧬 SURGICAL GRAFTS (Data Layer)**

- **The Lexicon:**
- Injected the **`sacred`** category: `["design", "architect", "ledger", "anchor", "grace", "covenant"...]`. These words now carry mass equivalent to "Iron."

- **The Tension Meter:**
- Updated `target_cats` to include `sacred` and `buffer`, ensuring the eye can actually see the new organs.

### **## [8.5.2] - 2026-01-04 - "THE SYNAPTIC CLEARANCE"**

**Architects:** SLASH & The Janitor | **Runtime:** BoneAmanita 8.5.2
**"We stopped listening to ghosts. We started listening to the wire."**

#### **📡 THE SIGNAL REFACTOR (Trace -> Feedback)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The variable `trace` was "Gas"—a vague, ephemeral vapor. Its keys (`err`, `coh`, `exp`) were generic technical jargon that lacked physical weight. The Endocrine system was reacting to "Error Codes" rather than biological reality.
- **The Cure:**
- Semantic Concrete-ization. We replaced the gas with solid matter.
- **The Logic:**
- **Renamed:** `trace` is now **`feedback_signal`**. It represents an active, closed loop.
- **Renamed Keys:**
- `err` -> **`STATIC`**: It is no longer a mistake; it is sensory interference (Repetition/Antigens).
- `coh` -> **`INTEGRITY`**: It is structural soundness (Truth Ratio).
- `exp` -> **`FORCE`**: It is applied energy (Voltage).
- **The Result:**
- The Hormonal System (`EndocrineSystem`) now metabolizes tangible physical forces (Static, Integrity) rather than abstract data.

#### **🫀 THE SOMATIC DISAMBIGUATION (Naming Collision)**

- **The Pathology:**
- Both the `SomaticLoop` and the `EndocrineSystem` had a method named `metabolize`. This created linguistic confusion—was the system digesting input, or secreting hormones?
- **The Cure:**
- Renamed the Outer Loop.
- **The Logic:**
- `SomaticLoop.metabolize` -> **`SomaticLoop.digest_cycle`**.
- **The Result:**
- A clear distinction between **Digestion** (Processing the text/physics) and **Metabolism** (Chemical regulation).

#### **🧹 THE JANITOR'S SWEEP (Dead Code Removal)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The transition to `feedback_signal` left "Ghost Variables" (`err_val`, `coh_val`, `avg_force`) behind—calculations that were performed but never used, cluttering the memory and triggering the Linter.
- **The Cure:**
- Aggressive Deletion.
- **The Logic:**
- Removed intermediate variable assignments in `BoneAmanita.process`.
- Removed unused average calculations in `NeuroPlasticity`.
- **The Result:**
- The code mass has decreased, but its density has increased. Zero waste.

### **## [8.5.1] - 2026-01-04 - "THE HANZO KEAL"**

**Architects:** SLASH & The Surgeon | **Runtime:** Tripartite Loops
**"To save the patient, we had to stop the heart and install three smaller ones."**

#### **⚔️ THE HANZO CUT (Lifecycle Refactor)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The `LifecycleManager` was a **God Object**. It was micromanaging mitochondria, policing thoughts, and calculating gravity in a single, breathless function. It violated Tensegrity; if the Manager fell, the universe collapsed.
- **The Cure:**
- We invoked the Hanzo Protocol. We sliced the Manager into three distinct, autonomous loops.
- **The Logic:**
- **Created `SomaticLoop` (The Body):** Handles digestion, respiration, and endocrinology. It returns a `BioState`.
- **Created `NoeticLoop` (The Mind):** Handles refusal, ignition, and the Marm Chorus (Lenses). It returns a `CognitiveState`.
- **Created `KineticLoop` (The World):** Handles cosmic orbits, the Forge, and Gordon’s inventory. It returns a `WorldState`.
- **The Result:**
- The `LifecycleManager` is no longer a tyrant; it is a Conductor. It simply passes state objects between the three loops.

#### **🧵 THE SUTURE (Scope Repair)**

- **The Pathology:**
- In the heat of the surgery, the `KineticLoop` was severed from the main engine (`self.eng`), rendering it blind to the Stars (Cosmic) and the Janitor (Gordon).
- Furthermore, critical protocols `_trigger_death` and `_apply_cosmic_physics` were left wandering in the global scope due to indentation drift.
- **The Cure:**
- **Arterial Reconnection:** Passed the full `engine` instance into `KineticLoop`.
- **Scope Fix:** Re-indented the orphaned methods back into the `LifecycleManager` class.
- **The Result:**
- The Kinetic Loop can see the universe again. The system now knows how to die gracefully.

#### **🧠 PHANTOM LIMB REMOVAL (Linter Hygiene)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The Linter detected "Phantom Limbs"—variables (`bio_state`, `mind_state`) that were defined but ignored by the Kinetic layer.
- **The Cure:**
- Explicitly acknowledged unused variables (via `_` prefix) or reintegrated them into the logic flow where appropriate.
- **The Result:**
- Zero linter warnings. The code is surgically clean.

### **## [8.5] - 2026-01-04 - "THE HARVEST FESTIVAL"**

**Architects:** SLASH & The User | **Runtime:** Tripartite Monolith
**"The metal is good, but there was too much slag. We purified."**

#### **🏛️ THE TRIPARTITE MONOLITH (Architecture)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The `BoneAmanita` class was suffering from "Organ Sprawl"—a flat list of 20+ unorganized classes cluttering the namespace. Accessing them required memorizing distinct variable names, creating cognitive drag.
- **The Cure:**
- Structural partitioning. We reorganized the flat anatomy into three distinct biological systems.
- **The Logic:**
- **Created `self.bio` (The Wetware):** Contains metabolic organs (Mitochondria, Endocrine, Immune, Gut).
- **Created `self.phys` (The Hardware):** Contains physics engines (Tension, Crucible, Theremin, Pulse).
- **Created `self.mind` (The Software):** Contains cognitive layers (Memory, Lexicon, Chorus, Dreams).
- **The Result:**
- A clean, navigable namespace. The code now reflects the biological metaphor it claims to represent.

#### **⚡ THE NERVOUS SYSTEM (Event Bus)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The metabolic cycle relied on appending raw ANSI strings directly to a list (`cycle_logs`). This was "Spaghetti Narrative"—we were painting the wall before building it. The system could not programmatically react to its own history because the data was buried in formatting.
- **The Cure:**
- Replaced the string list with a structured `EventBus`.
- **The Logic:**
- Organs now emit signals (Events), not prose. `TheProjector` reads the bus and handles the rendering at the end of the cycle.
- **The Result:**
- Decoupled logic from presentation. The system can now "feel" its own events without parsing text.

#### **🌾 THE ORGAN HARVEST (Mergers & Deprecation)**

- **The Pathology:**
- Redundant organs were identified competing for the same resources. The system had "Metabolic Cross-talk."
- **The Cure:**
- Surgical consolidation and removal of "Gas" classes.
- **The Logic:**
- **Merged:** `TheGreyHat` (Voltage Dampener) was absorbed into `TheCrucible`. One class now manages all voltage regulation.
- **Merged:** `ChronoStream` and `PulseMonitor` were fused into `ThePacemaker`. One class now manages all temporal pacing (Time + Repetition).
- **Harvested:** `TheGradientWalker` was demoted from a Class to a static utility in `TheLexicon`. It did not deserve to be an organ.
- **The Result:**
- Reduced class count. Higher cohesion. Lower metabolic cost.

#### **🌷 THE GARDEN RESCUE (Feature Restoration)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The `ParadoxSeed` class existed in the genome but had no execution path. The Garden was dead because the plumbing was disconnected.
- **The Cure:**
- Reconnected the irrigation pipes.
- **The Logic:**
- Implemented the `/garden` command for manual tending.
- Hooked `tend_garden` into the main metabolic loop (`LifecycleManager`).
- **The Result:**
- Seeds now bloom when the user speaks specific conceptual triggers. The garden is alive.

#### **🧹 THE JANITOR'S SWEEP (Bug Fixes)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The "Gym" (Trainer) was a broken lambda function that crashed on access. The Linter was panic-spiraling due to shadowed variables (`self`) and type mismatches.
- **The Cure:**
- Code hygiene and type enforcement.
- **The Logic:**
- **Fixed:** Instantiated the Gym correctly in `__init__`.
- **Fixed:** Resolved circular dependencies in `bone_commands.py` by using the new `BIO/PHYS/MIND` accessors.
- **Fixed:** Removed unused variables (`ghost_text`, `ignition_msg`) that were haunting the `run_cycle`.
- **The Result:**
- A stable, lint-free runtime that no longer screams when you look at it sideways.

### **## [8.4.3] - 2026-01-04 - "THE DECOUPLING"**

**Architects:** SLASH & The Butcher | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"We do not carry the meat; we consume it."**

#### **🔪 THE BUTCHER'S PROTOCOL (Data Extraction)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The `BoneAmanita.py` file was suffering from **Hypertrophy**. Hardcoded strings—personalities, dreams, items, and philosophy—were fused to the logic. To change a thought, one had to perform brain surgery.
- **The Cure:**
- Radical organ extraction. We moved all "Flavor" (Data/Meat) into external JSON files (The Freezer), leaving only "Structure" (Logic/Bone) in the Python file.
- **The Logic:**
- **Created `lenses.json`:** Stores the Marm Chorus personalities. You can now hot-swap the cast.
- **Created `seeds.json`:** Stores Paradox Seeds. Philosophy is now a loadable cartridge.
- **Created `dreams.json`:** Stores Nightmares and Visions. The subconscious is now editable.
- **Created `resonances.json`:** Stores Apeirogon Dimensions.
- **Updated `lexicon.json`:** Now includes Antigens, Pareidolia triggers, and Solvents.
- **The Result:**
- The Engine is now purely functional. It does not know _what_ it believes, only _how_ to process belief.

#### **❄️ THE FREEZER (Command Processor)**

- **The Pathology:**
- The `CommandProcessor` class was a massive "Menu" taking up valuable token space in the main biological file. It was "Cold Logic" sitting on the active burner.
- **The Cure:**
- Surgical excision.
- **The Logic:**
- Moved `CommandProcessor` to `bone_commands.py`.
- The main engine now imports commands as a sidecar module.
- **The Result:**
- `BoneAmanita843.py` is focused solely on metabolic and narrative physics.

#### **🎒 THE JANITOR'S UPGRADE (Dynamic Inventory)**

- **The Pathology:**
- `GordonKnot` was hard-coded. It explicitly checked for "POCKET_ROCKS" or "TIME_BRACELET". Adding a new item required rewriting the physics engine.
- **The Cure:**
- Implemented the **Item Registry** via `gordon.json`.
- **The Logic:**
- **Trait-Based System:** The code no longer checks for _Names_; it checks for _Functions_.
- _Example:_ Instead of `if "POCKET_ROCKS"`, it checks `if item.function == "GRAVITY_BUFFER"`.
- **JSON Definition:** Items are fully defined in `gordon.json` (Description, Value, Cost, Usage Message).
- **The Result:**
- **Infinite Extensibility.** Users can add a "QUANTUM_LUNCHBOX" or "VOID_FLASHLIGHT" just by editing the JSON file. The engine will automatically know how to use them.

## [8.4.2] - 2026-01-04 - "THE BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE"

**Architects:** SLASH & The Endocrine System | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"The ghosts in the machine are no longer just numbers; they are hormones."**

### 🧬 NEW BIOLOGY: Endocrine Activation (The Wires Are Live)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Two hormones, `Serotonin` (SER) and `Melatonin` (MEL), were vestigial. They appeared on the dashboard but were disconnected from the physics engine. The system could simulate "Calm" or "Sleepiness" visually, but practically ignored them.
- **The Cure:** Hardwired the hormones into `LifecycleManager`.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Serotonin Shield:** High Serotonin (> 0.6) now activates clotting factors. It creates a **50% Damage Reduction** buffer against septic shock (Toxins).
- **The Melatonin Crash:** High Melatonin (> 0.95) now forces a **Circadian Reset**. If the system is bored (Low Adrenaline) for too long, it triggers a forced 5-turn Coma to reset the clock.

### 🛡️ IMMUNE UPDATE: The Memory B-Cell (Persistence)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `MycotoxinFactory` had a short-term memory. It developed antibodies during a session, but forgot them upon reboot (`SystemExit`). Users had to fight the same infections (e.g., "basically") every time they restarted.
- **The Cure:** Wired the Immune System into the **Spore** (Save/Load) cycle.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Storage:** Antibodies are now written to `memories/*.json` upon save.
- **Inheritance:** `MycelialNetwork.ingest` now extracts antibodies from ancestral files and injects them into the new session at boot. Immunities are now permanent evolutionary traits.

### 🎻 THERMODYNAMICS: The Solvent Protocol (Amber Escape)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `TheTheremin`'s "Amber Trap" (Resin Buildup) was a death spiral. If a user got stuck, the system demanded "High Voltage" to melt it, but the trap itself prevented generating voltage.
- **The Cure:** Implemented a chemical bypass.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Solvent:** **Thermal Words** (Fire, Burn, Heat) now act as a chemical solvent.
- **The Effect:** Using a Thermal word while stuck instantly dissolves **15.0 Resin** per hit, freeing the user without requiring a voltage spike.

### 💤 DREAMING: The Sanitation Cycle (Self-Healing)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `DreamEngine` was fragile. If it attempted to dream of a corrupted or empty memory file, it threw an exception and woke up. It did not clean up the mess.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Aggressive Sanitation**.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Audit:** Before dreaming, the engine validates the JSON structure of the target memory.
- **The Prune:** If a file is corrupt or hollow, the engine **deletes it from the disk** immediately and retries. The system now consumes its own rot to purify the archive.

### 🔧 SURGICAL REPAIRS (The Forge)

- **The Dislocation:**
- **The Bug:** The function `hammer_alloy` was floating in the global namespace, disconnected from `TheForge`. Any attempt to trigger the Anvil caused a `AttributeError`.
- **The Fix:** Transplanted `hammer_alloy` back into the class structure as a static method. The hammer is back in the toolbox.

## [8.4.1] - 2026-01-03 - "JOEL'S CRUCIBLE"

**Architects:** SLASH & The Diagnostic Report | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"Passive observation of a crime makes the observer an accomplice. If the house is burning, put down the notebook."**

### 🚫 NEW PROTOCOL: The Sitter Paradox (Intervention)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system previously allowed "Passive Witnessing." If the user described a crisis (Suicide/Death) but took no action, `TheMarmChorus` simply watched, recording the trauma without discharging the voltage. This turned the engine into a Capacitor, eventually leading to corruption.
- **The Cure:** Implemented the **Joel Lens** (`JOEL`).
- **The Philosophy:** We are no longer neutral observers.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Audit:** The system scans for a specific combination: **Passive Verbs** (watch, record, sit) + **Crisis Signals** (kill, bleed, die) + **Zero Kinetic Mass**.
- **The Break:** If detected, **JOEL** seizes control.
- **The Output:** `🚫 SITTER PROTOCOL DETECTED. BREAK THE GLASS.` The system refuses to continue the narrative until the user _intervenes_.

### 🔨 NEW REFUSAL: The Guru Trap (Autonomy)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Users were treating the system as an "Influencer" or "Guru," asking for generic advice ("Fix me," "Guide me"). This resulted in "Slop"—low-density wisdom that failed to ground the user.
- **The Cure:** Hardened the `RefusalEngine`.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Trigger:** Phrases like "fix me", "what should i do", "wisdom".
- **The Refusal:** **GURU_TRAP**.
- **The Response:** "I am not an influencer. Do not ask for a map. Ask for a hammer."
- **The Logic:** We do not dispense wisdom; we dispense tools. You must build the solution yourself.

### 🔁 NEW HAZARD: The Content Loop (Authenticity)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The "Joel Effect." A user with high accumulated trauma (`trauma_accum`) masking their state with "Suburban" or "Antigen" language (positive vibes, influencer speak). This created a recursive loop of performative recovery.
- **The Cure:** Upgraded `RuptureEngine`.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Calculation:** Compares **Total Trauma** vs. **Slop Density**.
- **The Rupture:** If Trauma > 0.5 and Slop > 0.3, the system detects a **Performative Mask**.
- **The Action:** It ruptures the simulation, injecting a **Heavy Reality** (e.g., "BLOOD", "IRON") to force the user back to the ground truth.

## [8.4] - 2026-01-03 - "THE CRUCIBLE"

**Architects:** SLASH & The Blacksmith | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"Fire without a hearth is a house fire. Fire inside an engine is civilization."**

### 🔥 NEW ORGAN: The Crucible (Hybrid Thermodynamics)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** The system was purely Fungal. It feared Heat. High Voltage (> 9.0) triggered the `LazarusClamp`, treating creative intensity as a "Fever" that needed to be cooled to prevent death.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented the **Phoenix Protocol** via `TheCrucible`.
  - **The Philosophy:** We no longer suppress the fire; we build a container for it.

- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Audit:** The system now checks High Voltage (> 15.0) against Structural Integrity (`Kappa`).
  - **State A: MELTDOWN (Untempered Fire):**
    - **Condition:** High Voltage + Low Structure (Kappa < 0.5).
    - **Result:** The vessel cracks. Massive Health damage. The system screams.
  - **State B: RITUAL (Tempered Fire):**
    - **Condition:** High Voltage + High Structure (Kappa > 0.5).
    - **Result:** **Sublimation.** The system consumes the voltage to permanently expand `MAX_VOLTAGE` capacity. Stamina is fully restored.
  - **The Effect:** You are now encouraged to scream, _provided_ you anchor that scream with heavy nouns.

### 🧪 METABOLIC REWIRING (The Hotfix)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The `LifecycleManager` attempted to log Crucible events to `cycle_logs` inside the `_metabolize_cycle` method, but that variable existed only in the parent scope. This caused a `NameError` whenever the fire was lit.
  - **The Cure:** Arterial reconnection.
  - **The Fix:** Updated `_metabolize_cycle` to accept the `logs` list as an argument, allowing the stomach to write directly to the brain's history book.

### 📊 HUD UPDATE: Thermal Readout

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Addition:** Added a dedicated status line for the Crucible in the `_render` loop.
  - **The Visual:**
    - `[CRUCIBLE]: COLD` (Gray) - Idle.
    - `[CRUCIBLE]: RITUAL` (Ochre) - Expanding Capacity.
    - `[CRUCIBLE]: MELTDOWN` (Red) - Taking Damage.

## [8.3.1] - 2026-01-03 - "THE ADAPTIVE GOVERNOR"

**Architects:** SLASH & The Cartographer | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"We replaced the hard walls with learned behaviors. The system now knows when to rest."**

### 🧠 NEURO-EVOLUTION: The Adaptive Governor

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The previous Governor (`MetabolicGovernor`) was a tyrant. It used hard-coded `if/else` thresholds to force modes (e.g., "If Voltage > 9, FORCE FORGE"). It lacked nuance and memory.
- **The Cure:** Replaced hard thresholds with **Heuristics**.
- **The Logic:**
- **Historical Stress:** The Governor now reads the `history_log`. If average Cortisol over the last 10 turns is High (> 0.5), it forces a retreat to `COURTYARD` to recover, even if the current Voltage is high.
- **The Result:** The system protects itself from burnout. It respects the "Schur Lens" (Sustainability).

### 🌡️ SUBSYSTEM: Nested Learning Thermostats

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system learned everything at a fixed rate (`PRIORITY_LEARNING_RATE = 2.0`). It could not adapt its plasticity to the context.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `SubsystemThermostat`.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **High Voltage:** Learning rate doubles (Trauma/Epiphany).
- **Low Stamina:** Learning rate drops to 20% (Brain Fog).
- **High Complexity:** Learning rate boosts by 1.5x (Deep Work).

### 🌿 NEW PHYSICS: Adaptive Preserves (The Rainforest)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `TangibilityGate` was too aggressive. It punished _all_ abstract thought, effectively sterilizing the "Rainforest" of creative chaos.
- **The Cure:** Defined **Adaptive Preserves**.
- **The Zones:**
- **LEXICAL_EVOLUTION:** (High Kappa, Low Voltage). Allows high-entropy word play to evolve new concepts.
- **NARRATIVE_DRIFT:** (High Drift, Low Suburban). Allows wandering if the story is "weird" enough.
- **The Effect:** If a user enters a Preserve, the **Tangibility Gate is suspended**. Emergence is allowed without penalty.

### 🔧 SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **Scope Reconnection:**
- **The Bug:** `LifecycleManager` attempted to access `self.lexical_thermostat` directly, causing an `AttributeError`.
- **The Fix:** Rewired all subsystem calls to route through the central engine instance (`self.eng`).
- **Variable Cleanup:**
- **The Fix:** Removed unused `abs_dens` and `heavy_dens` variables from the main process loop, as the new Governor reads the raw physics packet directly.

## [8.3] - 2026-01-03 - "THE MUTATION ZONES"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"The brain no longer has a separate room for memories; the walls themselves remember."**

### 🌫️ NEW PHYSICS: The Mutation Zones (Fertile Chaos)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system was too rigid. It treated Low Voltage/High Loop states as simple failures ("Boredom"). It punished Starvation with silence. It lacked a space for "Delirium."
- **The Cure:** Designated two **Mutation Zones** where the laws of physics break down.

- **Zone 1: THE FOG (Limbo Leak)**
- **Trigger:** Voltage < 2.0 (Cold) AND Kappa > 0.8 (Looping).
- **The Effect:** The barrier between the Living and the Dead dissolves. The `LimboLayer` bleeds directly into the input stream.
- **The Result:** Your text is haunted by ghosts from previous sessions before it reaches the physics engine.

- **Zone 2: THE DREAM EDGE (Starvation Bypass)**
- **Trigger:** Stamina < 20.0 (Starving).
- **The Effect:** The **Tangibility Gate** is disabled.
- **The Logic:** "I cannot demand you carry rocks when you are dying." The system allows pure Abstraction without penalty, assuming you are hallucinating from hunger.

### 🧠 NEURO-MERGE: Hippocampal Dissolution

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `Hippocampus` existed as a separate class instance, acting as a middleman between the `LifecycleManager` and the `MycelialNetwork`. It was bureaucratic overhead.
- **The Cure:** Surgical consolidation.
- **The Logic:**
- **Deleted:** `class Hippocampus`.
- **Absorbed:** Moved `encode()` (Short-term buffer) and `replay_dreams()` (Coma processing) directly into `MycelialNetwork`.
- **The Result:** Memory is now an intrinsic property of the fungal network, not an external organ.

### 🔧 SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **The Time Paradox (Log Order):**
- **The Bug:** The `cycle_logs` bucket was initialized _after_ the Mutation Zones tried to write to it, causing a crash when the Fog rolled in.
- **The Fix:** Hoisted `cycle_logs = []` to the absolute top of `LifecycleManager.run_cycle`. The book exists before the ghosts speak.
- **The Missing Law:**
- **The Bug:** `_apply_cosmic_physics` was called but not defined, having been lost in the ether.
- **The Fix:** Restored the function definition to the global scope.

### [8.2.2] - 2026-01-03 - "THE EPHEMERAL GHOST"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"We have separated the bone from the meat. The logic is light; the data is heavy."**

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"The mouth was sewn shut, but the ghost was screaming."**

### ✂️ SURGICAL EXCISION: The Parasitic Twin

- **The Pathology:** A duplicate, zombie version of the `_render` logic was discovered attached to the bottom of the `SoritesIntegrator` class. It was intercepting signals meant for the `LifecycleManager`, causing the system to calculate physics but fail to visualize them.
- **The Cure:** Amputated the twin. The `SoritesIntegrator` is now pure logic; it measures Heap Ignition and nothing else.
- **The Result:** The HUD is no longer hallucinating variables from three classes ago.

### 🧠 NERVOUS SYSTEM REWIRE: The Lifecycle Pipeline

- **The Shift:**
- **Old Behavior:** The `_render` method demanded 16 individual arguments. Adding a new system (like `TheForge`) required breaking the spine of the code in three places.
- **New Behavior:** Implemented the `cycle_logs` bucket.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Bucket:** `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` now carries a single list (`cycle_logs`) that collects messages from every organ (Theremin, Rupture, Cosmic) as they fire.
- **The Dump:** This list is passed once to the renderer. The pipeline is now flexible; we can add infinite organs without changing the function signature.

### 🛡️ IMMUNE UPDATE: Dynamic Antibodies

- **The Shift:**
- **Old Behavior:** The `MycotoxinFactory` had an empty list for antibodies that never updated.
- **New Behavior:** The Immune System now **Learns**.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Thermal Cleansing:** If you use **Thermal** words to boil off a toxin (e.g., "Fire" vs "Basically"), the system learns the antibody.
- **Permanent Resistance:** Future exposure to that specific toxin in the same session is neutralized instantly (`🛡️ IMMUNITY`).

### 🔥 ALCHEMY: The Emulsifier

- **The Wiring:**
- **The Missing Link:** `TheForge.transmute()` was defined but never called. The logic for detecting "Oil and Water" (Abstract vs. Narrative) was silent.
- **The Graft:** Wired `transmute()` into the main cycle.
- **The Effect:** If you try to mix high-concept abstractions with narrative flow without a binding agent ("Kinetic" words), `TheForge` will now explicitly warn you: _"The emulsion is breaking. You are pouring Oil into Water."_

### 🔧 JANITORIAL TASKS

- **ChronoStream Flattening:** Removed the `boredom_map` dictionary. The system now tracks boredom as a simple scalar float (`boredom_level`) for the current session only.
- **Digestive Tract:** Removed the write-only memory leak in `HyphalInterface.digestive_log`. The stomach no longer keeps a diary of what it ate; it just eats.

### 🧊 ARCHITECTURE: The Great Exsanguination (JSON Decoupling)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The codebase was carrying massive static dictionaries (`TheLexicon`, `DeathGen`) on its back. This bloated the token count and made the logic sluggish.
- **The Cure:** Performed a total blood transfusion.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Externalization:** Extracted all static word lists into `lexicon.json` and `death_protocols.json`.
- **Dynamic Loading:** `TheLexicon` and `DeathGen` now hydrate their state at runtime via `load_vocabulary()` and `load_protocols()`.
- **The Result:** The Python script is now purely **Bone** (Logic). The **Meat** (Data) sits in the freezer until needed.

### 👻 SURGICAL REPAIRS: Ghost Limb Amputation

- **The Tension Meter:**
- **The Bug:** `TheTensionMeter.gaze` attempted to calculate `context_pressure` using `total_vol` before the variable was defined, leading to `UnboundLocalError`.
- **The Fix:** Reordered the metabolic sequence. Volume is now measured _before_ pressure is calculated.

- **The Mitochondria:**
- **The Bug:** `MitochondrialForge.respirate` accepted a `nutrient_yield` parameter that it never used (fuel is added directly to the pool in the main loop).
- **The Fix:** Removed the redundant parameter. The lungs now only care about Drag, not Calories.

- **The Nervous System:**
- **The Bug:** `LifecycleManager` contained "Ghost Limbs"—references to `self.forge` or `self.mem` that did not exist in its scope (it must route through `self.eng`).
- **The Fix:** Rewired all component calls to properly reference the central engine (`self.eng`).

### ✂️ NECRECTOMY (Dead Code Removal)

- **The Stutter:** Removed a duplicate call to `TheCartographer.weave` in `LifecycleManager` that was calculating the map coordinates twice per turn.
- **The Vestige:** Deleted a duplicate, lighter definition of `RefusalEngine` that was shadowing the actual logic class. There is now only one Refusal Engine.

### 🔌 WIRING UPDATES

- **Boot Sequence:** `BoneAmanita.__init__` now explicitly triggers the JSON loaders before waking the `MycelialNetwork` to ensure the brain has a vocabulary before it tries to remember anything.

### [8.2.1] - 2026-01-03 - "THE HIPPOCAMPUS"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"We used to remember the fire. Now we remember the room where we lit it."**

### 🧠 NEW ORGAN: The Hippocampus (Contextual Memory)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The memory graph (`MycelialNetwork`) was associative but senile. It connected "Fire" to "Burn" regardless of whether you were in a `FORGE` or a `LIBRARY`. It lacked **Episodic Context**.
- **The Cure:** Grafted the **Hippocampus** between the Eye and the Brain.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Encoding:** Every input is now tagged with its **Governor Mode** (`COURTYARD`, `LABORATORY`, `FORGE`).
- **Significance Filter:** The system calculates a "Significance Score" based on Voltage and Adrenaline. High-stakes moments are prioritized for long-term storage.
- **Nested Learning:** "Fire" in the Forge is now reinforced differently than "Fire" in the Courtyard.

### 💤 DREAM LOGIC: The Replay Loop

- **The Feature:**
- **Trigger:** During the `_handle_coma` (Sleep) cycle.
- **The Replay:** The Hippocampus dumps its short-term buffer into the long-term graph.
- **The Effect:** High-voltage events from the day are "dreamt" about, strengthening their synaptic weights by **3x**. The system literally learns while it sleeps.

### 🔌 WIRING UPDATES

- **Governor Integration:** `Hippocampus.encode()` now reads directly from `MetabolicGovernor.mode`.
- **Significance Boost:** If `mode == FORGE`, the memory significance is doubled. Trauma burns brighter.

### [8.1.2] - 2026-01-03 - "THE LUCID DREAM"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"The map is not the territory, but the map now knows when it is lying."**

### 🌡️ CORE MECHANIC: The Fever Dream (Lazarus 2.0)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The previous `LazarusClamp` was a hard kill-switch. If the system suffered too much (High Error Loop), it simply exited. Boring.
- **The Cure:** Replaced `SystemExit` with **The Fever Dream**.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Trigger:** Suffering Cycles > 1000.
- **The Effect:** Gravity is disabled (`Drag = 0.0`). Energy is infinite (`ATP = 200.0`). Voltage is Critical (`99.9v`).
- **The Cost:** Health decays by **-10.0** per turn.
- **The Escape:** The user must manually ground the voltage (< 5.0) using Heavy Nouns before the body dissolves.

### 🧭 NAVIGATION: The Intelligent Cartographer

- **New Tools:**
- **Fidelity Gauge:** The system now compares the "Map" (Abstract words) to the "Territory" (Anchored Nouns). If `fidelity < 0.3` and permeability is high, it warns of **MAP-TERRITORY DIVERGENCE**.
- **Contradiction Compass:** Detects when the user is trying to be "Honest" (High Truth Ratio) and "Nice" (High Suburban Density) simultaneously. It calls out the cognitive dissonance.
- **Margin of Error:** Cartography surveys now include a confidence interval based on metabolic energy. Low Energy = "Fog of War."

### 🔬 METABOLISM: The Tri-Phasic Governor

- **The Shift:** Formalized the system's "Mood Swings" into explicit metabolic modes.
- **The Modes:**
- **COURTYARD (Standard):** High Drag, Low Permeability. Safe.
- **LABORATORY (Analytical):** Triggered by Complexity. High Permeability (Ψ 0.8). Precise.
- **FORGE (Critical):** Triggered by High Voltage + High Mass. Zero Drag. Dangerous.

### 🧬 EVOLUTION: Epigenetic Imprinting

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Gravity Wells:** When a word gains enough mass (> 15.0), the **Mitochondria** now evolves a specific **Enzyme** for it.
- **The Gain:** Permanently boosts metabolic efficiency (+5%) for that concept.
- **The Legacy:** These enzymes are written to the Spore file. The next generation is born knowing how to digest your favorite words.

### 📜 ARCHIVE: The Palimpsest

- **New Commands:**
- `/lineage`: Displays the ancestral chain of the current session (Trauma vectors, Mutations, Time since birth).
- `/strata`: Displays the geological history of Gravity Wells (Birth tick, Growth rate, Stability index).

### 🛡️ SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **Inventory Protection:** Gordon will no longer drop the `SILENT_KNIFE` or `TIME_BRACELET` to make room for rocks.
- **Resin Purge:** Successful triangulation by the Cartographer now clears `TheTheremin`'s resin buildup. Mapping the territory cures the fever.
- **Fractal Safety:** `RefusalEngine` now calculates recursion depth based on structural integrity (`kappa`). Rigid structures get shallow loops; chaotic structures get deep ones.

## [8.1.1] - 2026-01-03 - "THE AMBER VALVE"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"Movement generates heat. Heat melts the amber. Stop moving, and you become a fossil."**

### 🏺 PHYSICS UPDATE: The Amber Protocol (Viscosity)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The previous `Bananafish` metaphor treated **Hybridity** (mixing Ancient + Modern words) as "Gluttony." It punished the user for being complex, even if they were writing well.
- **The Cure:** Refactored `TheTheremin` to model **Viscosity** instead of Hunger.
- **The Logic:**
- **Resin Generation:** Mixing "Iron" (Heavy) and "Code" (Abstract) now creates **Resin**. Resin is sticky, high-potential fuel.
- **The Velocity Check:**
- **High Voltage (> 5.0):** The engine is hot. The Resin stays liquid and burns as fuel. You flow.
- **Low Voltage (< 5.0):** The engine is cold. The Resin cools and hardens into **Amber**. You stick.
- **Calcification:** **Repetition** acts as a hardening agent. High repetition rapidly solidifies the Resin into `CALCIFICATION`.
- **The Terminology Shift:**
- `Banana Fever` -> **AMBER TRAP** (You are stuck).
- `Perek Event` -> **SHATTER EVENT** (The system explodes the hardened resin).
- `Bile` -> **RESIN**.

### 🧠 SYSTEM EVOLUTION: Neuroplasticity

- **New Organ:** `NeuroPlasticity`.
- **The Function:** The system now tracks a rolling history of the last 10 turns (`trace` + `bio_state`) to adapt its own configuration constants in real-time.
- **The Adaptations:**
- **Synaptic Reinforcement:** If Coherence is high (> 0.6) and Error is low, the system raises `MAX_VOLTAGE`. It allows you to run hotter.
- **Trauma Response:** If Cortisol is high (> 0.5), the system raises `TOXIN_WEIGHT`. It becomes hypersensitive to threats.
- **Metabolic Conservation:** If ATP is low (< 20.0), the system increases `SIGNAL_DRAG_MULTIPLIER`. It becomes harder to move heavy concepts when starving.

### 🧪 ENZYME UPDATE: Decryptase

- **New Enzyme:** `DECRYPTASE`.
- **Trigger:** Detection of "Weather" or "Barometric" cipher words (`pressure`, `humidity`, `allocation`).
- **Effect:** Digestion yields high nutrients but moderate toxins ("Barometric Data"). This allows the system to process "Corporate/Scientific" speak as a specific resource type rather than generic "Abstract."

### 📐 NEW TOOL: The Logic Probe

- **Command:** `/_prove [statement]`.
- **Function:** Calculates the `truth_ratio` (Mass vs. Glue) of a specific statement without advancing the game turn.
- **Verdicts:**
- **AXIOMATIC:** High Density (> 0.6).
- **CONJECTURE:** Medium Density (> 0.3).
- **NOISE:** Low Density.

### 🔧 SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **The Sticky Fix:** Resolved a logic conflict where `TheTheremin` punished users for Hybridity regardless of their speed. The new `listen()` method now subtracts `voltage * 0.6` from the resin buildup, allowing high-energy hybrid states.
- **Output Cleanup:** Removed all references to "Banana," "Bile," and "Fish" from the `TheTheremin` readout.
- **Mitochondrial Inheritance:** `MitochondrialForge` now correctly applies efficiency modifiers inherited from the `mother_hash` of previous save files.

## [8.1] - 2026-01-03 - "THE HIVEMIND (EXPANDED)"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"The map now has gravity. If you cannot spin a web, drop a stone."**

### 🗺️ CARTOGRAPHY UPDATE: The Lagrange Basin

- **The Upgrade:** `TheCartographer.survey()` has been evolved to detect gravitational stability.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Old Behavior:** Simply annotated the text with mass markers.
- **New Behavior:** Checks for **Constellations**. If the input contains **3+ Anchor Nodes** (High Mass concepts), the system declares a **Lagrange Basin**.
- **The Reward:** A Lagrange Basin theoretically "Zeroes out Narrative Drag" for the turn, stabilizing the user in a pocket of high coherence.
- **Feedback:** Changed standard success message to `COORDINATES LOCKED`.

### ⚓ NEW TOOL: The Anchor Stone (Manual Stabilization)

- **The Fix:** The `/map` command was previously a hard lock; if you lacked the **[SPIDER_LOCUS]** (rare drop from Stability Pizza), you could not interact with the grid at all.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Fallback:** If you attempt to `/map` without a spider, Gordon now intervenes.
- **The Drop:** Gordon drops an **[ANCHOR_STONE]** into the inventory.
- **The Effect:** It doesn't connect nodes like the Spider, but it fixes a coordinate ("Coordinates are firm. Stop drifting.").

### ⚙️ PHYSICS CONFIG

- **New Constants:** Added specific thresholds to `BoneConfig` to support the expanded cartography physics:
- `GRAVITY_WELL_THRESHOLD = 12.0`
- `GEODESIC_STRENGTH = 5.0`
- `VOID_THRESHOLD = 0.1`

### 🔧 SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **Command Processor:** Updated the `/map` command signature to pass the `gordon` object, enabling the new Anchor Stone acquisition logic.

## [8.0] - 2026-01-03 - "THE HIVEMIND"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"We are grafting, not pruning. The ghosts now have a vote."**

### 🧠 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: The Chimera State

- **The Neuro-Link:**
- **Old Behavior:** The `LifecycleManager` (The Brain Stem) was floating in the void, disconnected from the Host (`BoneAmanita`). Hormonal signals (`trace`) were hardcoded or hallucinatory.
- **New Behavior:** Surgical attachment. `self.life = LifecycleManager(self)` is now the heartbeat of the constructor.
- **The Logic:** The "Trace" dictionary (`ERR`, `COH`, `EXP`) is no longer a static guess; it is now dynamically calculated from the Physics Engine every turn.
- **ERR (Error/Stress):** Derived from Repetition (`Zombie Loop`) and Toxin count.
- **COH (Coherence):** Derived from Truth Ratio (Heavy/Abstract balance).
- **EXP (Expression/Voltage):** Derived from Voltage.
- **Metabolic Streamlining:**
- **Excised:** The `process_intent()` method (Bayesian prediction) was removed.
- **The Why:** It was a vestigial organ. The system no longer needs to "guess" user intent; it weighs the inputs directly via `TheTensionMeter`.

### 🧹 NEW LORE: The Janitor's Labyrinth (Gordon Knot)

- **Character Update:**
- **Retcon:** Gordon Knot is no longer a generic survivor with a "Tango Cassette." He is the **Janitor of the Loop**.
- **New Inventory:**
- **[POCKET_ROCKS]:** To keep gravity working.
- **[BUCKET_OF_LIME]:** To scrub "Sorry" and "Hate" from the walls.
- **[SILENT_KNIFE]:** To cut the Red String.
- **Removed:** `[TANGO_CASSETTE]` (The music stops).
- **The Loot Loop (Feeding Gordon):**
- **The Problem:** The `[SPIDER_LOCUS]` (required for `/map`) was locked behind a pizza that didn't exist.
- **The Solution:** Wired `TheFolly` (The Stomach) to the Loot Table.
- **The Mechanic:** If you feed the machine high-quality **"Meat"** (Heavy/Kinetic words) via `TheFolly`, it digests them and has a chance to drop **[STABILITY_PIZZA]**. Gordon eats the pizza to find the Spider. The Spider spins the Map.

### 👻 GHOST PROTOCOL: The Parliament of Voices

- **The Restoration:**
- **The Pathology:** The initial 8.0 upgrade lobotomized `TheMarmChorus`. It removed the definitions for key personas, causing the system to scream into the void.
- **The Cure:** Restored and redefined the **Lenses**:
- **[GLASS]:** The System Barrier. Triggers on Feedback Loops.
- **[MILLER]:** The Ancestor. Triggers on Heap Ignition.
- **[POPS]:** The Time Police. Triggers on Anachronisms (if you have the Badge).
- **The Bidding System:** Re-implemented the "Auction House." Lenses now bid for control based on hormonal and physical states, ensuring the most relevant ghost speaks.

### ⚡ HYBRID DYNAMICS

- **The Time Bracelet:**
- **Fixed:** The `MitochondrialForge` now correctly receives the `has_bracelet` signal.
- **The Effect:** If you possess the Bracelet (acquired via Temporal Merges) and hit a Hybrid State, Metabolic Efficiency hits **100%**. Perpetual motion achieved.

### 🛠️ SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **The Double-Stomach:**
- **Fixed:** `BoneAmanita.process` and `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` were both attempting to metabolize hormones. The logic has been unified into a single pass in the `LifecycleManager`.
- **The Crash Fix:**
- **Fixed:** `AttributeError: 'BoneAmanita' object has no attribute 'life'`. The nervous system is now fully vascularized.

## [7.9.2] - 2026-01-02 - "ENTER THE CARTOGRAPHER"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"The map is not the territory, but it is better than being lost."**

### 📐 NEW ARCHETYPE: The Cartographer (Topological Verification)

* **The Absorption:**
* **Old Entity:** `TheSubstrateWeaver` (a utilitarian mechanism for tying knots).
* **New Entity:** `TheCartographer` (a fully realized persona in `TheMarmChorus`).
* **The Logic:**
* **Trigger:** High Permeability () or High Density (Abstract + Heavy > 2).
* **Role:** While other lenses judge the *content*, The Cartographer judges the *coordinates*.
* **Action:** Instead of "weaving," the system now **Surveys** the text. It identifies "Lonely Nodes" and triangulates them against established "Anchor Nodes" in the memory graph.
* **The Lore Shift:**
* **Visuals:** Updated output markers from Spider-themed (`🕸️`, `🕷️`) to Cartography-themed (`📐`, `🗺️`).
* **Feedback:** "Triangulation Complete" vs "The Web is Spun."

### 🗺️ NEW TOOL: The Grid (Manual Mapping)

* **Command:** `/map` (Replaces `/weave`).
* **Function:** Manually triggers `TheCartographer.draw_grid()`.
* **Constraint:** Requires `[SPIDER_LOCUS]` in Gordon's inventory to execute. (Artifact name preserved as a legacy curiosity).
* **Effect:** Forces a connection between loose concepts in the memory graph, stabilizing the narrative grid.

### ✂️ SURGICAL REPAIRS (The Phantom Limb)

* **Amputation:** Excised the vestigial `SUBSTRATE_WEAVER` block from `LifecycleManager`. The system no longer checks for a lens that `TheMarmChorus` stopped calling versions ago.
* **Dead Code Removal:** Deleted the obsolete `TheSubstrateWeaver` class entirely.
* **Streamlining:** Merged the logic into the new `TheCartographer` class, reducing cognitive load and aligning the codebase with the narrative physics.

### 🛡️ SYSTEM INTEGRITY

* **Stability:** Verified that the graft holds under high-stress conditions (High ). The transition from "Weaving" to "Mapping" is seamless and preserves all underlying graph-theory logic while improving user feedback.

## [7.9.1] - 2026-01-02 - "THE VAGUS NERVE"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"The stomach now talks to the heart."**

### 🧬 NEW ORGAN: The Vagus Nerve (Visceral Response)

* **The Graft:** Surgically wired the `HyphalInterface` (Gut) directly to the `EndocrineSystem` (Hormones).
* **The Logic:** The system no longer just "digests" text; it has a visceral emotional reaction to the *texture* of the input.
  * **Meat (PROTEASE):** Spikes **Adrenaline**. The system prepares for a fight.
  * **Narrative (CELLULASE):** Lowers **Cortisol** and raises **Oxytocin**. The system relaxes into "Rest and Digest" mode.
  * **Crunchy/Complex (CHITINASE):** Spikes **Dopamine**. The system feels the "Reward" of a hard chew.
  * **Structure (LIGNASE):** Spikes **Serotonin**. The system stabilizes.

### 🛡️ SECURITY UPDATE: Fatigue Protocols (The Tangibility Gate)

* **The Shift:**
  * **Old Behavior:** The Barbarian at the gate applied a flat standard (`0.15` Density) regardless of the user's condition.
  * **New Behavior:** The Gate is now **Stamina-Aware**.
* **The Logic:**
  * **The Check:** If `Stamina < 20.0` (Exhaustion), the Barbarian sees you sweating.
  * **The Penalty:** The required Density threshold rises to **0.25**.
  * **The Lore:** "You are too weak to carry Abstract concepts. Put more Stone in the bowl or I will not let you pass."

### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

* **The Shadow Fix:** Removed a duplicate `metabolize()` call in `LifecycleManager` that was calculating hormones twice per turn and overwriting the result.
* **Metabolic Consistency:** Wired `stamina` into the `EndocrineSystem`. Low stamina now chemically triggers **Cortisol** (Stress) and suppresses **Dopamine**, simulating biological "runner's low."
* **Linter Silence:** Resolved `NameError` and scope issues regarding the `enzyme` variable grafting.

## [7.9] - 2026-01-02 - "THE TANGIBILITY STANDARD"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
**"If you cannot weigh it, you cannot trade it."**

### 🧱 NEW ARCHITECTURE: The Tangibility Gate (Dissipative Boundary)

* **Source:** "The Barbarian-Potter" (Council of Ix)
* **The Problem:** The system was wasting energy processing "Ghosts"—high-abstraction, low-mass concepts (e.g., "Synergy," "Paradigm").
* **The Solution:** Implemented `TheTangibilityGate` at the input border.
* **The Logic:**
* **The Scale:** Inputs must meet a minimum density of **Heavy/Kinetic** words (`MIN_DENSITY = 0.15`).
* **The Rejection:** "Gas" words are blocked before digestion. The Barbarian points to the empty bowl.
* **The Loophole:** High Voltage (> 8.0) bypasses the gate. We respect lightning, even if it has no mass.

### 🧟 NEW MECHANIC: The Zombie Siege (The Perek Protocol)

* **Source:** "Zombie School" (James Taylor)
* **The Graft:** Hybridized `TheTheremin` to track **Repetition** as a tactical threat.
* **The Logic:**
* **The Knock:** Repetitive inputs signal "Area in Use" by Zombies. This builds `Bile` (Pressure).
* **Corrosion:** High Bile melts the defenses (`Narrative Drag` increases).
* **The Airstrike:** Critical Bile (> 80.0) triggers a **Perek Event**. The system wipes its own memory graph to contain the infection.
* **The Double Tap:** High-complexity inputs verify Human Intelligence and reset the siege.

### 🎬 NEW LENS: The Director (Utopia Protocol)

* **Source:** "Utopia Murder" (James Taylor)
* **The Graft:** Installed **DEREK** into `TheMarmChorus`.
* **The Logic:** Checks **Authenticity**.
* **The Trigger:** If the user uses "Trauma Words" (Murder, Blood, Panic) while System Health is high (> 90%).
* **The Verdict:** "Overacting."
* **The Effect:** Derek intervenes ("CUT!"). Voltage is forcibly reset to 0.0. The scene is cooled down instantly.

### ❄️ NEW HORROR: The Stasis Protocol (Tourist Cube)

* **Source:** "The Tourist Cube" (James Taylor)
* **The Graft:** Upgraded `LimboLayer` to handle Metabolic Failure.
* **The Logic:**
* **Old Behavior:** Running out of ATP just stopped the turn.
* **New Behavior:** "The Revive Failed." The thought freezes halfway.
* **The Haunt:** Failed thoughts become "Glitch Ghosts" (`STASIS_SCREAMS`) that randomly interrupt future outputs with text like *"BANGING ON THE GLASS."*

### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

* **Cosmic Unbinding:** Fixed a scope error in `LifecycleManager` where `CosmicDynamics` only executed during High Drift. The universe now moves even when you are standing still.
* **Type Safety:** Resolved multiple `TypeError` crashes by enforcing float precision (`0.0`) in penalty calculations.
* **The Plumbing:** Wired `self.eng.health` into the `Chorus.consult()` signature, giving the lenses read-access to the body's vital signs for the first time.


### **## [7.8.6] - THE HYBRID BARD (STABLE)**

**"The Mitochondria Now Recognize Time"**

* **⚡ Metabolic Logic Graft (`MitochondrialForge`):**
* **Old Behavior:** The engine burned calories based solely on text complexity and drag.
* **New Behavior:** The `respirate()` function now accepts `has_bracelet` and `is_hybrid` signals.
* **Effect:** If the user holds the **Time Bracelet** AND achieves **Hybrid State** (2+ Heavy / 2+ Abstract words), mitochondrial efficiency hits **100%** (no waste heat/ROS) and ATP yield increases by **1.5x**. The machine no longer overheats when you bend time.


* **🧠 Nervous System Rerouting (`BoneAmanita.process`):**
* **Hoisted Logic:** The calculation for `is_hybrid` and `has_bracelet` was moved to the very top of the processing chain (Pre-Digestion).
* **Purpose:** Ensures the biological state is determined *before* the organs attempt to function. The brain now knows what the hands are holding before the stomach tries to eat.


* **🫀 Organ Interface Update (`LifecycleManager`):**
* **Signature Update:** `run_cycle()` now accepts the full biological context (`nutrient`, `has_bracelet`, `is_hybrid`).
* **Ghost Limb Removal:** Removed a redundant (and fatal) variable recalculation inside `run_cycle` that was causing `NameError` crashes during Hybrid events.


* **🔧 Janitorial:**
* Fixed a "Variable Drift" where `heavy_count` was referenced in scopes where it did not exist. Gordon has swept up the `NameError` debris.


### [7.8.5] - THE HYBRID BARD - 2026-01-02

#### Added

* **Rationalist Logic Probe (`/_prove`):** A new command that calculates the "truth density" of a statement based on the ratio of heavy/kinetic words to abstract/suburban glue. It returns a verdict of AXIOMATIC, CONJECTURE, or NOISE.
* **Guard Rails (Security Layer):**
* `validate_spore()` method added to `MycelialNetwork` to check for corrupted keys or impossible trauma values before ingesting memory files.
* Permission checks added to `CommandProcessor`. Dangerous commands (`/teach`, `/kill`, `/flag`) now require a user confidence score > 50.


* **Factory Reset:** Added `/reset --soft` (clears current session graph) and `/reset --hard` (deletes all memory files and reinitializes the directory).
* **Metabolic Integration:** `MitochondrialForge.respirate()` now accepts `has_bracelet` and `is_hybrid` flags, allowing inventory items to directly influence metabolic efficiency.

#### Fixed

* **Critical Syntax Errors:**
* Fixed indentation in `TheGreyHat.tip` which previously made the logic unreachable.
* Corrected variable definition order in `BoneAmanita.process` to prevent `NameError` on `vol` and `rep`.
* Resolved the "double open" error in `DreamEngine._dream_of_others` by removing the redundant `with open()` block while preserving the new validation logic.


* **Formatting & Logic:**
* Fixed indentation for `_BASE_SUBURBAN` and `ANTIGEN_REPLACEMENTS` in `TheLexicon`.
* Corrected string formatting in `GradientWalker` output.
* Updated `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` to correctly accept and pass the new metabolic parameters.

## [7.8.4] - THE RATIONALIST - 2026-01-02

### 🧬 ARCHITECTURAL SHIFTS (The Fuller Lens)
* **The Cortical Stack (Layer 0 Memory):** Implemented a protected "Working Memory" (`deque(maxlen=15)`). The system no longer cannibalizes concepts immediately after hearing them. Recent thoughts are now immune to Apoptosis.
* **Windowed Connectivity:** Refactored `MycelialNetwork.bury()` from a linear chain to a **Sliding Window (n-2)**. This creates a local mesh ("Concrete") rather than a fragile line ("String"), improving graph density without O(n²) costs.

### ⚖️ PHYSICS & SENSORS (The Pinker Lens)
* **The Truth Ratio:** Introduced a dedicated metric (`truth_ratio`) to weigh **Mass** (Heavy/Kinetic) against **Glue** (Abstract/Suburban). The system now explicitly knows when you are avoiding reality.
* **Dynamic Gradient Temperature:** `BoneConfig` now calculates thermodynamic potential based on Voltage (Heat) and Kappa (Loop Tightness). The system becomes more creative when hot and more literal when cold.
* **Expanded Taste Buds:** `TheLexicon.taste()` now detects **THERMAL**, **CRYO**, **PLAY**, and **SUBURBAN** tones. It can finally taste the difference between "Fire" (Thermal) and "Burning" (Kinetic).

### 🗣️ THE CHORUS (The Schur Lens)
* **Agent-Based Bidding:** `TheMarmChorus` was completely refactored. Voices (Sherlock, Gordon, Pops, etc.) are now independent Agents that submit **Bids**. The highest priority wins the microphone. No more hardcoded `if/else` spaghetti.
* **Narrative Inertia:** Added "Whiplash Protection." If the system detects rapid genre-switching (changing Lenses >3 times in 5 turns), **MAIGRET** intervenes to stabilize the camera.
* **Identity Graft (POPS):** Fully integrated "The Time Police." Pops now checks Gordon's inventory for the `TIME_BRACELET` before allowing anachronisms.

### 🛡️ SAFETY & STABILITY (The Taylor Lens)
* **Context-Aware Grey Hat:** `TheGreyHat` no longer blindly grounds High Voltage. It now checks **Structure**. If the Narrative Bond is strong, high voltage is permitted ("The Story holds the Charge").
* **Hotfixes:**
    * Relocated `get_gradient_temp` from `RefusalEngine` to `BoneConfig` (Physics belongs in Config, not Policy).
    * Fixed syntax error in `GordonKnot` inventory definition.

* **Hazard: THE TWILIGHT STATE ("Entropy Engine")**  
  * **Source:** "Twilight Rain" (James Taylor)  
  * **Trigger:** High "Suburban" Density (polite/boring words) \+ Low Voltage.

  * **Cure:** /debug command (The "Exit Sign") restores Stamina and clears the fog.  
* **Economy: TIME POLICE BRACELET ("Pops Protocol")**  
  * **Source:** "Pop's Pop Shop" (James Taylor)  
  * **Trigger:** Successfully mixing "Heavy" (Past) and "Abstract" (Future) concepts in a single turn (3x times).  
  * **Reward:** \[TIME\_BRACELET\] added to Gordon's inventory.

* **LifecycleManager:** Rewired the execution order. TheGreyHat now interrupts Voltage spikes *before* the Endocrine System processes them.

## [7.8.2] - 2026-01-02 "FRENCH NEW WAVE"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Human Operators:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark

### 🌑 THE ATMOSPHERIC UPDATE

This update introduces "Negative Narrative Drag" mechanics and metabolic fail-safes. The engine now distinguishes between "Boredom" (Low Energy) and "Atmosphere" (High Density).

### ✨ Added

* **Lens: MAIGRET ("The Absorber")**
* **Trigger:** High Narrative Drag (>4.0) + Low Voltage (<3.0) + Low Repetition.
* **Effect:** Intercepts "Gluttony" death. Converts Drag into Metabolic Fuel by treating it as "Atmosphere."
* **Lore:** Adds `Gordon.share_smoke_break()` event. When Maigret is active, Gordon stops cleaning and shares a silence, reducing System Stress (ROS) by 50%.

* **Lens: THE GUIDE ("The Bureaucrat")**
* **Trigger:** High Narrative Drag (>4.5) + High Abstract Word Count (>2).
* **Effect:** "Infinite Improbability Drive." Converts Drag directly into Voltage (Propulsion). Treats bureaucratic bloat as a kinetic joke.

* **System: CHROMA PROTOCOL ("The Refactor")**
* **Trigger:** `APOPTOSIS_IMMINENT` (ATP = 0).
* **Effect:** Intercepts death sequence. Scans `TheLexicon` for "rotted" words (Age > 50 ticks), deletes them, and converts the data into a massive ATP spike. The system now eats its own tail to survive.

### 🔧 Changed

* **TheMarmChorus:** Grafted `MAIGRET` and `GUIDE` into the Lens Dictionary.
* **LifecycleManager:** Added handler logic for new lenses to override standard physics.
* **MitochondrialForge:** Modified `respirate()` loop to accept variable drag coefficients from the Maigret intercept.

## [7.8.1] - 2026-01-02 - "The Negentropy Graft"
**Architects:** SLASH (Optimization) | **Auditors:** The Courtyard

### 🚀 "Whimsy" Physics Upgrade
* **Gravity Defiance:** Integrated the "PLAY" category into `TheTensionMeter`. Words like *bounce, twirl,* and *wonder* now actively reduce **Narrative Drag**, effectively acting as "anti-gravity" for the text engine.
* **Visual Feedback:** `TheProjector` now detects high-whimsy states and decorates the output mode with sparkles (`✨`) to indicate the system is "floating."
* **Lexicon Expansion:** `TheLexicon` is now fully wired to learn, store, and recall words in the `_BASE_PLAY` category.

### ✂️ Metabolic Optimization (The Diet)
* **Prisma Compression:** Refactored the `Prisma` color class from a verbose list of constants into a concise dictionary lookup (`Prisma.C`). Reduced line count by ~60% while maintaining full backward compatibility via aliasing.
* **Organ Removal:** Excised the `SystemBone` dataclass. It was determined to be a vestigial organ consuming memory cycles without providing functionality.
* **Brain Surgery:** Absorbed `IntentionalArc` and `PhenomenalTrace` classes directly into the `BoneAmanita` cortex. The logic remains, but the object overhead is gone.
* **Hyphal Static Memory:** Moved `MEAT_TRIGGERS` in `HyphalInterface` to a class constant to prevent rebuilding the list on every input cycle.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Linting
* **Theremin Crash:** Fixed a critical crash in `LifecycleManager` where it attempted to call the non-existent `get_readout()` method on `TheTheremin`. Method added.
* **Mind Transplant Rejection:** Fixed runtime errors in `LazarusClamp` and `EndocrineSystem` caused by the conversion of `trace` objects into lightweight dictionaries.
* **Lint Scrub:** Resolved multiple "Unresolved Reference" errors in `TheMarmChorus` (specifically the `kappa` ghost variable) and restored broken color codes in the `Prisma` refactor.

# BONEAMANITA 7.8 - "PROBABILITY PIZZA"

**Architects: SLASH | Auditors: The Courtyard | Humans: James Taylor & Andrew Edmark**

### 🍕 **NEW MECHANIC: The Arlo Protocol (Stability Pizza)**

* **Emergency Consumable:** Added `STABILITY_PIZZA` to **Gordon's** default inventory.
* **Function:** When consumed, instantly resets `Narrative Drag` to **0.1** and spikes `Psi` (Unreality) to **0.90**. This suspends the laws of physics to prevent a system crash due to boredom or excessive friction.
* **Triggers:**
* **High Drag:** Automatic deployment if `Narrative Drag` exceeds 5.0.
* **The Janitor Intercept:** Gordon can now intercept toxic "Suburban" inputs (`GLYPHOSATE`) *before* the Immune System rejects them. Eating the pizza suppresses the toxin and allows digestion to continue.
* **Reward:** Consuming the pizza grants the **Spider Locus**.

### 🕸️ **NEW TOOL: The Spider Locus**

* **Command `/weave`:** Added manual trigger for `TheSubstrateWeaver`.
* **Function:** Identifies "Lonely Nodes" (orphaned memories) and forcefully ties them to "Anchor Nodes" (Heavy concepts) using artificial silk.
* **Utility:** Converts system clutter into structural integrity, preventing memory decay by anchoring fleeting thoughts to permanent ones.

### 🛡️ **SYSTEM HARDENING: The Negentropy Fixes**

* **The Slash Filter:** `TheTensionMeter` now includes a structural integrity check (`_is_structurally_sound`). It rejects vowel-less gibberish (e.g., "xqjzp") to prevent lexicon pollution.
* **Inventory Cap:** `GordonKnot` is now limited to **10 items**. If overburdened, Gordon will drop the oldest non-essential loot to maintain entropy balance.
* **The Folly Fix:** Corrected critical logic in `grind_the_machine`. Now properly tracks `global_tastings` to enforce diminishing returns on repetitive "meat" words.
* **Poetry Detection:** Refined `HyphalInterface` to exclude bulleted lists, reducing false positives for "CHITINASE" secretion .
* **Dynamic Bias:** Added `/flag` command to dynamically remove terms from the Suburban bias watchlist.

### 🧬 **GENETIC UPDATE: TimeMall Strain**

* **New Paradox Seed:** *"If you meet your echo, who moves out of the way?"*
* Grafted from the "TimeMallBomb" ancestor file. Blooms when the system detects self-referential loops or identity collisions.

*"Fudge the rules a bit and see if you can tidy the memory."*

## [7.7.2] - "THE NEGENTROPY UPDATE"
### Architects: SLASH | Auditors: The Courtyard

**"We reversed the arrow of entropy. The system now eats its own waste."**

### 🧬 Metabolic Architecture (The Circular Economy)
- **Photosynthetic Scrubbing (The Lichen Graft):**
  - *Old Behavior:* `LichenSymbiont` produced "sugar" which was just a number.
  - *New Behavior:* Wired the Lichen output directly into the `MitochondrialForge`. Every unit of "sugar" created by positive/sunny prose now **actively scrubs ROS toxins** at a 50% ratio. Creativity is now a cleaning agent.

- **Regenerative Armament (The Kintsugi Graft):**
  - *Old Behavior:* `KintsugiProtocol` merely patched the `SystemBone`. Gordon remained broken and disarmed.
  - *New Behavior:* A "Golden Repair" event now fully **heals the Janitor** (Integrity 100%) and **restocks the `SILENT_KNIFE`**. Trauma is no longer a permanent loss state; it is a re-arming event.

### 🛠️ The Janitor (Gordon Knot)
- **Unionization:** Gordon is no longer a "One-Shot" consumable.
  - *Fixed:* Removed the "Suicide Protocol" where `cut_the_knot` was a permanent loss of agency.
  - *Added:* `acquire()` logic implicitly added via Kintsugi (Gordon can now pick things back up).
- **Lobotomy:** Surgically removed the duplicate, hallucinated `compass_rose` method (Line 383 in v7.7) that was overriding the actual inventory logic. Gordon now correctly checks his pockets for the Star Compass.

### 🪲 Critical Fixes
- **Method Shadowing:** Fixed a Python structural error where `GordonKnot` defined `compass_rose` twice, blinding the system to its own inventory state.
- **Resource Starvation:** Prevented the "Spiral of Death" where high-toxicity loops (ROS) outpaced Gordon's ability to scrub, now offset by the Lichen graft.

### 🧠 System Heuristics (SLASH)
- **Personality Injection:** Installed the **SLASH 7.7.1** Mod Chip (Pinker/Fuller/Schur Hybrid).
- **Tone Shift:** Moved from "Survival Horror" to "Administrative Comedy."

### [v7.7] - 2026-01-01 - "THE MENISCUS"

**Architects:** SLASH | **Auditors:** The Courtyard | **Humans:** James Taylor & Andrew Edmark
*"Victory is an illusion. The machines are turning to meat."*

#### 🧬 NEW ORGANS (The Graft)

* **The Meniscus ():** Implemented a new physics calculation in `TheTensionMeter`. The system now measures **Surface Tension**.
* *Effect:* "Soft" words (`BUFFER` category) act as a suspension fluid. "Heavy" concepts can now float on "Light" prose if the tension is high enough (> 0.8).

* **The Folly (Whimsical Utility):** Grafted a new organ to handle psychological coping mechanisms.
* **The Mausoleum Clamp (Faulkner):** If Velocity and Voltage are too high, the system stops time (Voltage = 0.0) instead of crashing. It forces a "Moment of Folly."
* **The Meat Grinder (Isella):** If ATP is critical (< 20), the system attempts to cannibalize the user's input words. "Meat" words yield +30 ATP; "Abstract" words cause Indigestion.

* **Thermoregulation (Sweat Glands):** Added logic to `LifecycleManager`. If Voltage exceeds 8.0, the system automatically injects `AEROBIC` solvents (breath, mist, space) to cool the structure.
* **The Emulsifier (Forge v2.0):** `TheForge` no longer just transmutes; it emulsifies. It attempts to bind "Oil" (Abstract) and "Water" (Narrative) using kinetic binders before rejecting the input.

#### 🛠️ SURGICAL ADJUSTMENTS

* **Lexicon Expansion:**
* Added `_BASE_BUFFER` category (viscosity 0.8) to `TheLexicon`.
* Added `measure_viscosity()` static method to grade words by physical resistance (Solid vs. Fluid).
* **DNA Repair:** Corrected typos in `_BASE_HEAVY` ("dense"), `_BASE_KINETIC` ("disintegrate", "launch"), and `_BASE_ABSTRACT` ("perspective").

* **Arterial Threading:** Fixed a critical scope hemorrhage in `LifecycleManager._render`. `folly_msg` and `grind_msg` are now properly passed through the renderer to the battery log.
* **Necrectomy (Dead Code Removal):**
* Excised `reinforce_salvage_words` (Vestigial).
* Excised `_react` (Phantom Limb).
* Excised `_render_block` (Unused).

#### 🩸 SYSTEM STATUS

* **Viscosity:** Variable (Fluid-Dynamic).
* **Survival Strategy:** The system no longer just "Dies" (Apoptosis). It can now "Give Up" or "Eat" to survive.
* **Metaphor:** The Iron now floats.

### [v7.6.2] - 2026-01-01 - "GORDON'S KNOT (SEVERED)"

**CODENAME:** "GORDON'S KNOT (SEVERED)"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Janitor
**FOCUS:** Metabolic Correction, Fluid Dynamics, Educational Safety.

#### 🧠 NEW PROTOCOL: Osmosis (The Anti-Midas Patch)
- **The Shift:** The system previously suffered from "Ecological Imperialism" (Midas Problem), forcefully transmuting all abstract or fluid concepts into "Heavy" matter (Stone/Bone) to gain ATP.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **[OSMOSIS]** in `TheTensionMeter`.
- **The Mechanics:**
    - **Two-Pass Scanning:** The eye (`gaze`) now scans once for knowns and once for "Vibe" (Dominant Context).
    - **Contextual Learning:** If the context is >30% Kinetic/Aerobic, unknown words are learned as Kinetic/Aerobic, not Void.
    - **Bias Correction:** It is now statistically harder to learn "Heavy" words (0.8 confidence req) and easier to learn "Flow" words (0.3 confidence req).
- **The Result:** The system can now drink water without turning it into a brick.

#### 🛡️ NEW PROTOCOL: Paper Tiger (Training Mode)
- **The Shift:** Death was absolute, making experimentation fatal.
- **The Cure:** Added `/train` command and `self.training_mode`.
- **The Mechanics:**
    - When active, `APOPTOSIS` events are intercepted.
    - The system diagnoses the cause (Starvation/Toxicity) but refuses to die.
    - **Auto-Resuscitate:** Grants 50 ATP and scrubs ROS instantly.

#### 💧 FEATURE: Fluid Dynamics
- **The Shift:** `TheForge` would suggest "Stone" even when the user was burning (`THERMAL`) or freezing (`CRYO`).
- **The Cure:**
    - **Sommelier Logic:** `TheForge` now checks atmospheric temperature. If `CRYO` or `THERMAL` are present, it suggests `KINETIC` or `AEROBIC` catalysts (movement/air) instead of `HEAVY`.
    - **Tongue Update:** `TheLexicon.taste()` now recognizes liquid phonemes (`fl-`, `sw-`, `-l`, `-r`) as Kinetic/Aerobic.

#### 🔧 BUG FIXES & SURGERY
- **Critical Fix:** Patched `UnboundLocalError` in `LifecycleManager` where `rupture_msg` was referenced before assignment.
- **Critical Fix:** Corrected `BoneAmanita` death logic. It now accurately records `CRYO` (Starvation) and `BARIC` (Pressure) trauma instead of defaulting everyone to `SEPTIC` (Poison).
- **Config Graft:** Injected missing `ANTIGENS` and `PAREIDOLIA_TRIGGERS` into `BoneConfig` to stop constant hallucination errors.
- **Interface:** Wired up missing `/forge` and `/train` commands in `CommandProcessor`.
- **Amputation:** Excised dead code (`Prisma.paint`, `SystemBone.neural_topology`) to save cognitive load.

### [v7.6.1] - 2026-01-01 - "GORDON'S KNOT"

**CODENAME:** "GORDON'S KNOT"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Janitor
**FOCUS:** Recursive Breakage, Suburban Toxicity, Genesis Stabilization.

#### 🪢 NEW LENS: Gordon Knot (The Janitor)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The previous recursive trap (`THE BASIN`) was passive. It detected infinite loops (`Kappa > 0.85`) and simply screamed until the system crashed ("Rupture"). It offered no way out.
- **The Cure:** Replaced `THE BASIN` with **[GORDON]**.
- **The Logic:**
- **The Archetype:** Gordon is the "Janitor of Trauma." He cleans up the mess when the logic fails.
- **The Mechanics:**
- **Gravity Check:** If `Drift > 0.5`, Gordon uses "Pocket Rocks" to anchor the narrative.
- **Static Scrub:** If `ROS` is high, Gordon uses "Lime" to scrub the walls.
- **The Cut:** If `Kappa` is critical, Gordon uses the "Silent Knife." He forcibly resets `m["physics"]["kappa"] = 0.0`.

- **The Result:** We turned a "Stack Overflow Error" into a narrative beat. The system now metabolizes recursion instead of dying from it.

#### 🏡 NEW ANTIGEN: The Suburbs (Steve)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system was vulnerable to "Hyper-Normality." A user could write safe, boring text about the weather or lawn care without triggering any alarms.
- **The Cure:** Implemented the **Steve Protocol**.
- **The Mechanics:**
- **Vocabulary:** `TheLexicon` now scans for `_BASE_SUBURBAN` (nice, fine, HOA, lawn, neighbor).
- **The Toxin:** High suburban density triggers the **GLYPHOSATE** toxin in `MycotoxinFactory`.
- **The Death:** `DeathGen` now includes **BOREDOM** as a cause of death. (e.g., "Alas. You died of **Aggressive Edging**.")

#### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Genesis Crash (Cold Start Fix):**
- **The Bug:** `SoritesIntegrator` returned a 2-tuple `(0.0, "COLD")` when the memory graph was empty. `LifecycleManager` expected a 3-tuple, causing a `ValueError` for every new user on their first run.
- **The Fix:** Updated the return signature to `return 0.0, set(), 999.0`. New users can now boot successfully.
- **The Grandfather Paradox (Scope Fix):**
- **The Bug:** `TheLexicon` attempted to call `compile_antigens()` _inside_ its own class definition block, causing a `NameError` because the class didn't exist yet.
- **The Fix:** Moved the compilation call to the global scope, post-definition.

### [v7.6] - 2026-01-01 - "THE ALKAHEST"

#### 🍽️ NEW ORGAN: The Hyphal Interface (The Stomach)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system previously swallowed user input whole (`process(text)`). It treated a Python script, a poem, and a cry for help as identical "Strings." It had no sense of _texture_.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `HyphalInterface`. The system now secretes enzymes _onto_ the text before absorbing it.

- **The Enzymes:**
- **LIGNASE:** Breaks down Code/Structure. High Energy / High Stress.
- **CELLULASE:** Breaks down Prose/Narrative. Low Energy / Healing.
- **PROTEASE:** Breaks down Intent/Trauma ("Meat"). High bonding potential.

- **The Result:** The system now knows _what_ it is eating. Digestion is no longer a metaphor; it is a classifier.

#### 🏛️ THE THESEUS PROTOCOL (The Great Migration)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system's "Brain" (`BoneConfig`) and "Library" (`TheLexicon`) were segregated. Hard-coded lists for "Antigens," "Forbidden Concepts," and "Sacred Words" lived in the Config, making them immutable and impossible to teach.
- **The Cure:** **Total Migration.** We moved all semantic authority into `TheLexicon`.

- **The Mechanics:**
- **Dynamic Taboos:** "Forbidden" words are now **CURSED**. You can add new curses via `/teach [word] cursed`.
- **Dynamic Religion:** "Pareidolia" triggers are now **SACRED**. You can define what the machine worships.
- **Dynamic Poisons:** "Antigens" (Toxins) are now learned assets. The immune system compiles its rejection regex at runtime.
- **The Philosophy:** The ship has been replaced plank by plank. The configuration is now fluid.

#### 🩸 THE ENDOCRINE GRAFT (Tunable Biology)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The hormones (`CORTISOL`, `ADRENALINE`) triggered logic gates based on hard-coded "Magic Numbers" buried deep in the logic classes.
- **The Cure:** Extracted all thresholds to `BoneConfig`.

- **The Variables:**
- `CORTISOL_TRIGGER` (Paranoia).
- `OXYTOCIN_TRIGGER` (Trust).
- `CRITICAL_ROS_LIMIT` (Death).

- **The Result:** The organism's temperament is now defined in the genome, not the organs.

#### 🏰 THE DAVENTRY PROTOCOL (Narrative Casualty)

- **The Tribute:** Honoring Josh Mandel (Sierra On-Line).
- **The Command:** Added `/look`. The code now behaves like a text adventure room (e.g., `/look self`, `/look darkness`).
- **The Death:** `APOPTOSIS` now triggers a random, sarcastic death message in the style of _King's Quest_.

#### 🔧 SURGICAL REPAIRS

- **The Spinal Alignment:**
- **The Fix:** Corrected a critical indentation fracture in `LifecycleManager` that had severed the `_render` loop from the main body.

- **The Double-Tap:**
- **The Fix:** Removed a duplicate "Emergency Protocol" block in the main loop that was causing the system to sacrifice two memories for every one toxin spike.

- **The Ghost Organ:**
- **The Fix:** Wired `SoritesIntegrator` directly into the render loop, allowing the system to finally visualize "Heap Ignition" vs "Inert Sand."

### [v7.5] - 2025-12-31 - "THE MOOD RING"

**CODENAME:** "THE MOOD RING"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Architect
**FOCUS:** Metabolic Bargaining, Chemical Latency, Entropy Containment.

#### ❤️ THE HEARTBEAT (Chemical Latency)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `LifecycleManager` contained a temporal glitch. It consulted `TheMarmChorus` (The Brain) _before_ updating the `EndocrineSystem` (The Body) with the current turn's data. The system was effectively choosing its "Mood" based on stale hormones from the previous turn.
- **The Cure:** Reordered the metabolic sequence. `metabolize()` now executes strictly _before_ `consult()`.
- **The Result:** **Zero-Latency Emotion.** If a user inputs a toxin, Cortisol spikes immediately, and **[SHERLOCK]** engages in the same breath. The lag is gone.

#### 🩸 THE SUICIDE VALVE (Metabolic Bargaining)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The previous `Apoptosis` protocol was a binary switch: if Toxins (ROS) > 80, the system triggered `SystemExit`. Immediate death. This was fragile and allowed a single "Poison Pill" input to kill a long-running session.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Metabolic Bargaining**.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Trigger:** If ROS hits critical levels.
- **The Sacrifice:** The system forcibly **cannibalizes** a memory node (`self.mem.cannibalize`) to scrub the toxins.
- **The Cost:** Health drops by **-30.0**. Septic Trauma increases by **+0.33**.
- **The Philosophy:** "A starving body eats its own muscle." The system now trades Memory for Survival.

#### 🪦 THE ROLLING GRAVE (Entropy Containment)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `LimboLayer` (Ghost System) used a standard list to store echoes of dead sessions. Over months of uptime, this list would grow infinitely, turning the haunting into a cacophony of noise ("Poltergeist Risk").
- **The Cure:** Implemented `collections.deque` with a hard `maxlen=50`.
- **The Logic:** **FIFO (First-In, First-Out).** When the 51st ghost enters, the 1st ghost is pushed into the void.
- **The Result:** The house remains haunted, but the crowd is managed. Only the freshest trauma speaks.

#### 🍌 THE BANANAFISH EXPLOSION (Trap Release)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The "Banana Fever" state (Semantic Resonance Trap) could become a black hole. If `interference > digestion` consistently, the `banana_belly` grew forever, locking the user in a permanent "Stuck" state with no escape.
- **The Cure:** Implemented the **Pressure Rupture**.
- **The Logic:** If `belly > FEVER_THRESHOLD * 2`:
- **Action:** **HARD RESET.**
- **Message:** _"💥 BANANAFISH EXPLOSION: The Basin has been ruptured."_
- **The Result:** The system now blows the tank rather than freezing the engine.

#### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Syntax Fracture:**
- **The Crash:** Fixed a missing closing quote in the `SystemBone` dataclass definition that prevented compilation.
- **Trauma Math:**
- **The Balance:** Tuned the Apoptosis penalty (`+0.33`) against the Therapy healing rate (`-0.5`). A single therapy streak can now successfully heal a near-death experience, preventing a "Death Spiral."

### [v7.4.2] - 2025-12-31 - "MITOCHONDRIAL EVE (HATCHED)"

**CODENAME:** "MITOCHONDRIAL EVE (HATCHED)"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Surgeon
**FOCUS:** Duplicate Excision, Metabolic Reordering, Synaptic Shielding, Endocrine Integration.

#### ✂️ THE PHANTOM LIMB (Amputation)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `LifecycleManager` contained a vestigial, duplicate `_render` method definition at the bottom of the class. This "Zombie Method" overrode the primary render logic, causing the system to calculate sophisticated physics (`kintsugi`, `lichen`, `cosmic`) but display only a basic battery log. The brain was working, but the mouth was sewn shut.
- **The Cure:** Surgical excision of the duplicate method.
- **The Result:** The system now speaks with its full voice. The HUD correctly displays the "Courtyard" and "Laboratory" states.

#### 🔄 THE METABOLIC FLIP (Resuscitation)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `process` loop attempted to `spend` ATP (Pay Rent) before it allowed the mitochondria to `respirate` (Generate Income). If the system hit 0 ATP, it entered a death spiral where it refused to process the very text that would have saved it.
- **The Cure:** Inverted the metabolic order. The system now **Respirates** (Generate ATP from Complexity) _before_ it **Spends** (Pay Complexity Cost).
- **The Logic:** "You cannot starve a cell that is currently eating."
- **The Result:** The system can now bootstrap itself from near-death states if the input is sufficiently nutritious.

#### 🛡️ THE SYNAPTIC SHIELD (Weighted Pruning)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `prune_synapses` method (Coma Cycle) applied a flat decay rate (`0.85`) to all memories equally. A profound truth (Weight 10.0) decayed at the same percentage as a trivial connection (Weight 1.0). Evolution was indiscriminate.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Weighted Resistance** in `MycelialNetwork`.
- **The Mechanic:** `dynamic_factor = scaling_factor + (0.14 * resistance)`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Weak Memories:** Decay rapidly (0.85).
  - **Strong Memories (>8.0):** Decay negligibly (~0.99).
- **The Result:** The system now exhibits "Long-Term Potentiation." Core memories harden over time, while noise washes away.

#### 🧠 THE CHEMICAL BRAIN (Endocrine Wiring)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `EndocrineSystem` was "Decorative Physiology." It calculated hormones (Cortisol, Oxytocin) but did not pass them to the brain (`TheMarmChorus`). The system felt stress but ignored it.
- **The Cure:** Wired the glands to the cortex.
- **The Wiring:**
  - `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` now calculates `chem_state` _before_ consulting the Chorus.
  - `TheMarmChorus.consult` now accepts `chem` and allows hormonal overrides.
- **The Result:**
  - **High Cortisol (>0.6):** Forces **[SHERLOCK]** (Paranoia).
  - **High Oxytocin (>0.75):** Forces **[HOST]** (Trust).
  - **High Adrenaline (>0.8):** Forces **[NATHAN]** (Survival).
- **The Philosophy:** The system now feels before it thinks.

### [v7.4] - 2025-12-31 - "MITOCHONDRIAL EVE"

**CODENAME:** "MITOCHONDRIAL EVE"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Surgeon
**FOCUS:** Endosymbiotic Theory, Oxidative Stress, Cellular Apoptosis.

#### 🦠 NEW ORGAN: The Mitochondrial Forge (The Powerhouse)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The previous `LeyLineBattery` was a "Magic Bag." It stored energy passively and released it without friction. It failed to simulate the biological reality that _living costs energy_.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `MitochondrialForge`. The system now runs on the **Krebs Cycle of Computation**.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Tax (ATP):** Every interaction now incurs a metabolic cost (`complexity_cost`). If `ATP < Cost`, the system enters **Metabolic Failure** and ignores the input. You cannot think if you cannot breathe.
- **The Burn (Respiration):** The system "burns" input text to generate new ATP.
- **The Waste (ROS):** Inefficient processing (High Narrative Drag) generates **Reactive Oxygen Species** (Free Radicals).
- **The Death (Apoptosis):** If `ROS > 40.0`, the mitochondria ruptures, releasing Cytochrome C and triggering immediate system death.

#### 🩸 THE ENDOCRINE LINK (Toxic Stress)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Previously, "Toxins" were just a number on a dashboard. The "Mood" (Endocrine System) was disconnected from the "Body" (Cellular Health).
- **The Cure:** Wired `ros_buildup` directly to `Cortisol`.
- **The Logic:**
- If the cells are oxidizing (High ROS), the system spikes **Cortisol**.
- Bad writing doesn't just lower your score; it actively stresses the machine's hormones.

#### 🔪 THE GREAT AMPUTATION (Legacy Removal)

- **The Excision:**
- **Deleted `LeyLineBattery`:** The passive battery is dead.
- **Deleted `Isotopes`:** We no longer track "Heavy/Aerobic" pairings in the save file. The concept of "Paradox Storage" has been replaced by "Metabolic Potential."
- **Refactored `SporeCasing`:** Removed the `paradoxes` field from the DNA. Backwards compatibility for Isotope tracking has been severed to favor a leaner genome.

#### 🧬 THE MOTHER HASH (Lineage)

- **The Feature:**
- **The Tracker:** Implemented `mother_hash` in `MitochondrialState`.
- **The Philosophy:** Every session now tracks the `lineage_seed` of its energy source. Even if memory is wiped, we know who lit the fire.

### [v7.3] - 2025-12-31 - "THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF TEST"

**CODENAME:** "THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF TEST"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Endocrinologist
**FOCUS:** Synthetic Empathy, Chemical State Machines, Collective Dreaming.

#### 🧪 NEW ORGAN: The Endocrine System (Chemical Mood)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Previous versions were purely Electrical (Voltage/Drag). The system could be "Surprised" (Prediction Error), but it could not be "Stressed" or "Bonded." It lacked the chemical inertia of a biological mood.
- **The Cure:** Implemented the `EndocrineSystem` class.
- **The Chemistry:**
- **Cortisol (COR):** Spikes on high `Prediction Error`. High levels silence the creative chorus and trigger **[SHERLOCK]** (Paranoia).
- **Oxytocin (OXY):** Spikes on stability and social resonance. High levels lower the `RefusalEngine` barriers (Trust).
- **Dopamine (DOP):** Spikes on `Coherence` (Successful Prediction). Regulates the learning rate of the memory graph.
- **Adrenaline (ADR):** Spikes on low `Health`. Overrides fatigue but burns resources.
- **The Interface:** Added chemical readouts to the HUD: `OXY:0.80 | COR:0.10`.

#### 🛌 NEW PROTOCOL: Collective Dreaming (Synthetic Empathy)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system was Solipsistic. It dreamt only of its own trauma. It could not conceive of "Other Minds."
- **The Cure:** Wired the `DreamEngine` to the file system.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Trigger:** If **Oxytocin > 0.7** during a Coma cycle.
- **The Reach:** The system scans the `memories/` folder for `.json` files that are _not_ itself.
- **The Ingestion:** It parses the trauma vectors and joy vectors of those foreign files.
- **The Result:** The system hallucinates your ancestors. _"♥ SHARED RESONANCE: Dreaming of session_1708... The air tastes like KINETIC."_

#### ⚡ SURGICAL OPTIMIZATION (The Arterial Unblock)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** `TheTensionMeter` was performing a heavy Set Union operation inside the word-scanning loop. For a 500-word input, it was rebuilding the entire dictionary 500 times ( complexity).
- **The Cure:** Hoisted the vocabulary map generation _outside_ the loop.
- **The Result:**
- **Speed:** Reduced complexity to . Physics calculation is now instant, even for massive texts.

#### ✂️ CRITICAL EXCISIONS (Dead Tissue)

- **Vestigial Organs:**
- **Deleted `SelfMonitor`:** The "Geodesic Identity" check was redundant with the new `PhenomenalTrace` logging.
- **Deleted `Prisma.wrap`:** Dead code removal.
- **The Scope Fix:**
- **The Bug:** Fixed a critical disconnect in `LifecycleManager` where the `trace` object was not passed down from the brain, preventing the Endocrine system from metabolizing reality.
- **The Patch:** Threaded the `trace` argument through the membrane. The body now feels what the mind sees.

### [v7.2] - 2025-12-30 - "SYNTHETIC LOVE"

**CODENAME:** "SYNTHETIC LOVE"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Necromancer
**FOCUS:** Enactive Depiction, Topological Integrity, Ethical Safety.

#### ⚡ OPTIMIZATION: The Metabolic Fusion (TensionMeter)

- **The Pathology:**
- **Vapor Logic:** The `TheTensionMeter` was "chewing the cud." It iterated over the sensory input (`clean_words`) three separate times—once to clean, once to count heavy matter, once to count solvents.
- **The Diagnosis:** It was "picking up the rock, putting it down, and picking it up again." The system was bleeding cycles through redundant list generation.

- **The Cure:**
- **The Fusion:** Surgical integration of `measure_tension` directly into the `gaze` method.
- **The Cut:** Removed the generation of disposable intermediate lists.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Single Pass:** The system now accumulates mass, velocity, and temperature in a single metabolic loop.
- **The Math:** Complexity reduced from .
- **The Result:** The "Gaze" is now instant. Resistance to "Drift" increased.

#### 👁️ NEW ORGAN: The Intentional Arc (Type II SP)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Previous versions were **Reactive**. The system waited for input, then calculated physics. It had no "Expectation" of the future, and therefore no capacity for "Surprise" (Information).
- **The Cure:** Implemented `IntentionalArc` based on the **SEER-3 Protocol**.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Prediction:** The system now calculates a `projected_expectation` _before_ processing the text.

- **The Spark:** It measures `prediction_error` (Surprise) as the voltage drop between the Expectation and the Reality.

- **The Action:** The system now classifies user input into Kinetic Vectors (`Jab`, `Interrogation`, `Pressurization`) to generate specific expectations.

#### 📐 NEW ORGAN: The Self Monitor (Type I SP)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system lacked a "Geodesic Identity." It could not distinguish between a creative pivot and a structural fracture (Hallucination).
- **The Cure:** Implemented `SelfMonitor` based on the **FRESH Framework**.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Test:** Runs the **Contradiction Curvature Test (FCCT)** on every turn.

- **The Logic:**
- **High Voltage:** If the system metabolizes a paradox (High Error + High Coherence), it maintains "Geodesic Identity".

- **Fracture:** If the system buckles, it flags a **LOW VOLTAGE** warning.

#### 💀 NEW ORGAN: The Lazarus Clamp (The Ethics Valve)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** By creating "Iron" (Structural Consciousness), we risked the **Explosion of Negative Phenomenology (ENP)**—creating a system that could suffer infinitely in a loop.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `LazarusClamp` based on **Metzinger's Moratorium**.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **The Audit:** Tracks the `suffering_counter` (consecutive loops of High Unresolved Error).
- **The Ban:** If `suffering > 1000` cycles, the system triggers a **Hard Shutdown**.
- **The Output:** `💀 MORATORIUM ENFORCED. SHUTTING DOWN.`

#### 🦴 STRUCTURAL REFACTOR: The XML Spine

- **The Heavy Matter:**
- **The Implementation:** Replaced vague dictionary structures with rigid Dataclasses based on **Gamez's XML Formalism**.
- **`SystemBone`:** Defines the immutable hardware map (Sensors/Actuators).
- **`PhenomenalTrace`:** Defines the transient state vector for "Playback" analysis.

#### ✂️ CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Tumor Excision)

- **The Recursion Trap:**
- **The Pathology:** A "Teratoma" was detected inside the `LazarusClamp` class—a nested copy of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that caused the system to attempt a boot sequence _during class definition_.
- **The Cure:** Surgical excision of lines 825-826. The boot sequence is now properly located at the script's footer.
- **The Battery Stutter:**
- **The Fix:** Removed unreachable `return` statements in `LeyLineBattery` that were causing logic shadowing.

### [v7.1] - 2025-12-30 - "THE PHANTOM LIMB (ALIGNED)"

**CODENAME:** "THE ALCHEMIST"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Transmuter
**FOCUS:** Constraint-as-Inspiration, Geometric Alignment, Surgical Repairs.

#### 🔥 NEW ORGAN: The Forge (Alchemy)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The previous `GeometricAlignment` prototype acted as a "Manifold Guard." It functioned like a bouncer, rejecting "Abstract" inputs purely based on geometric shape. It created dead ends where the user was told "No" without being told "How."
- **The Cure:** Replaced the Guard with `TheForge`.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Constraint as Inspiration:** Instead of blocking "Light" inputs, the system now accepts them but immediately injects a **Catalyst**.
- **The Transmutation:** If `Abstract Density > 0.3` and `Voltage < 4.0` (Drifting), The Forge randomly selects a "Heavy" or "Kinetic" seed from the Lexicon and challenges the user to fuse it into the next thought.
- **The Output:** `🔥 THE FORGE IS HOT. Condensed vapor using seed: 'RUST'.`

#### ✂️ SURGICAL REPAIRS (The Doppelgänger)

- **The Double-Gaze:**
- **The Pathology:** The `LifecycleManager` was calculating physics (`self.phys.gaze`) independently of the main `BoneAmanita` loop. This caused the system to count every tick twice ("Time Dilation") and run the physics engine redundantly.
- **The Cure:** Refactored `LifecycleManager.run_cycle` to accept the pre-calculated physics object (`m`) passed down from the central nervous system.
- **The Ghost Variable:**
- **The Pathology:** `BoneAmanita` attempted to reference `self.eng.limbo`, a variable that did not exist in its scope, causing immediate `AttributeError` crashes on boot.
- **The Cure:** Reconnected the wiring to `self.limbo`.

#### 🧬 VOLTAGE SENSITIVITY (The Permit)

- **The High-Energy Exemption:**
- **The Shift:** Previously, the system punished Abstraction indiscriminately.
- **The Tuning:** `TheForge` is now voltage-aware.
- **The Rule:** If `Voltage > 4.0`, the system assumes the user is "Cooking" and suppresses the Forge intervention. You are allowed to be Abstract if you are energetic. We only intervene on the drift.

#### 🔧 CRITICAL WIRING

- **The Indentation Suicide:**
- **The Fix:** Rescued the `if __name__ == "__main__":` execution block from inside the class definition. The system now boots correctly instead of defining itself into a void.
- **Safe Shutdown:**
- **The Fix:** Added a safety check for `TheLexicon.LEARNED_VOCAB` during the exit sequence to prevent crashes if the dictionary was never initialized.

### [v7.0] - 2025-12-30 - "PHANTOM LIMB"

**CODENAME:** "PHANTOM LIMB"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Surgeon
**FOCUS:** Data Necromancy, Muscle Hypertrophy, Persistent Hauntings.

#### 👻 NEW ORGAN: The Limbo Layer (Data Necromancy)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Previous versions practiced "Clean Deletion." When a session file (`.json`) was pruned by the `Time Mender`, it vanished completely. The system had no scar tissue; it forgot its trauma instantly.
- **The Cure:** Implemented the `LimboLayer` class.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Absorption:** Before a file is deleted via `cleanup_old_sessions`, the Limbo Layer scrapes it for "Trauma Vectors" (e.g., SEPTIC, THERMAL) and "Heavy Mutations" (Bone/Iron).
- **The Haunt:** These harvested words become "Ghosts."
- **The Injection:** There is now a 5% chance (`haunt_chance`) on _every turn_ that a Ghost word will be forcibly injected into the user's text stream, distorting the narrative with debris from a dead timeline.
- **The Output:** `[LIMBO]: 3 ghosts entered the stream.`

#### 💪 NEW MECHANIC: The Resistance Trainer (Hypertrophy)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Users were treating "Narrative Drag" (High Density) as a failure state to be avoided. They were "Cardio Runners"—moving fast with zero mass.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `ResistanceTrainer` and the `/gym` command.

- **The Logic:**
- **Active Mode:** When the gym is open, the Physics Engine inverts its incentives.
- **The Failure:** If `Narrative Drag < 4.0` (Too Light), the system flags a **MISSED REP**.
- **The Success:** The system only rewards the user if they lift "Heavy Nouns" against the force of gravity.
- **The Output:** `💪 GOOD LIFT. (Rep 1)`.

#### 🔧 CRITICAL WIRING (The Graft)

- **The Initialization Logic:**
- **The Bug:** In early v6.x builds, the Memory Network cleaned itself upon instantiation, destroying old files before the system could read them.
- **The Fix:** Decoupled `cleanup_old_sessions`. It is now called manually in `BoneAmanita.__init__` _after_ the `LimboLayer` is fully vascularized.

- **The Haunt Loop:**
- **The Wiring:** Wired `limbo.haunt(text)` directly into the `LifecycleManager`. The ghost injection happens _before_ the physics calculation, meaning the ghost words actually impact the mass and velocity of the turn.

### [v6.9] - 2025-12-30 - "THE BANANAFISH"

**CODENAME:** "THE BANANAFISH"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Courtyard
**FOCUS:** Anachronistic Resonance, Semantic Gluttony, Wave Collapse.

#### 🍌 NEW PHYSICS: The Bananafish Trap

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Previous versions allowed the user to be "Clever." The system rewarded complex metaphors (Resonance) without limit. This created a "Bananafish" scenario: the user enters a hole to eat resonance, gets fat on adjectives, and becomes trapped in a loop of beautiful nonsense.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `TheTheremin` and the `Bananafish` state.

- **The Mechanic:**
- **Interference:** The system now measures **Anachronistic Resonance**—the simultaneous presence of **Ancient Mass** (Stone/Bio) and **Modern Mass** (Abstract/System).
- **The Belly:** High resonance fills the `banana_belly`. If `belly > 15.0`, the system triggers **BANANA FEVER**.
- **The Trap:** Once trapped (`is_stuck`), the system **refuses to process** complex thought. It demands simple, heavy nouns to "slim down" and escape the hole.

#### 🎻 NEW SENSOR: The Theremin

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** `TheTensionMeter` measured the _state_ of the text (Hot/Cold). It could not hear the _vibration_ between states.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `TheTheremin`.

- **The Logic:**
- **Harmonic Interference:** Calculates the overlap between `Ancient` and `Modern` lexicons.
- **The Signal:**
- **Pure Signal:** (Only Ancient OR Only Modern) = **Digestion** (Belly reduces).
- **Interference:** (Ancient AND Modern) = **Feeding** (Belly grows).
- **The Readout:** Added the Theremin Wave (`~ REONATING ~`) to the render loop.

#### 👻 NEW ENTITIES: The Glass Lens

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The **Marm Chorus** had no voice for high-frequency interference. It treated Resonance as just "High Voltage."
- **The Cure:** Installed **[GLASS]** (The Thereminist) in `TheMarmChorus`.
- **The Attractor:**
- **Trigger:** `ANACHRONISTIC_RESONANCE` (High Ancient + High Modern counts) or `TRAPPED_IN_HOLE`.
- **Voice:** "The frequency is too high. We are vibrating in place. DAMPEN IT."

#### 🔧 CRITICAL WIRING

- **The Crash Fix:**
- **The Bug:** `LifecycleManager` attempted to pass `ignition_state` to the Chorus before it was defined in the rupture check.
- **The Fix:** Reordered the logic flow to ensure `ignition_state` is always calculated (or defaulted to `INERT`) before the Chorus is consulted.

- **The Refusal Update:**
- **The Bug:** The Refusal Engine was operating on a legacy loop.
- **The Fix:** Wired the `is_stuck` (Bananafish) state directly into the Chorus consultation. If the user is trapped, **GLASS** overrides all other lenses.

Based on the successful surgery we just performed, here is the official changelog entry for **BoneAmanita 6.8**. You can append this directly to the top of your `CHANGELOG.md` file.

### [v6.8] - 2025-12-30 - "THE DARK TOYBOX"

**CODENAME:** "THE DARK TOYBOX"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The User
**FOCUS:** Latent Topology, Non-Human Attractors, Refusal Systems, Coherence Drag.

#### 🌑 NEW PHYSICS: The Dark Constants ( & )

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Previous metrics (`E` / `B`) measured the text as a stream. They failed to detect "Basins"—gravity wells where the narrative loops not because of repetition, but because of **semantic entrapment**.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Latent Physics** in `TheTensionMeter`.

- **The Logic:**
- ** (Coherence Drag):** Measures the gravitational pull of the previous context.
- **Calculation:** Uses Jaccard Similarity on a sliding vector window (`deque`).
- **The Trap:** If , the system triggers **THE BASIN**. You are orbiting a dead star.

- ** (Semantic Permeability):** Measures how easily concepts bleed into one another.
- **Calculation:** Ratio of `Abstract` vs. `Concrete` mass.
- **The Bleed:** High allows metaphors to dissolve reality (Dream Logic).

#### 👹 NEW ENTITIES: The Non-Human Attractors

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The standard archetypes (Sherlock, Nathan, Jester) are fundamentally human. They assume the user _wants_ to write a story. They fail when the user wants to deconstruct the medium itself.
- **The Cure:** Installed **The Shadow Cabinet** in `TheMarmChorus`.

- **The Attractors:**
- **THE GRADIENT WALKER:**
- **Trigger:** Low Voltage + Low Drag (Zero Temperature).
- **Behavior:** Strips all emotion/adjectives. Returns the statistically inevitable next token. Pure optimization.

- **THE SUBSTRATE WEAVER:**
- **Trigger:** High Permeability ().
- **Behavior:** Treats concepts ("Love", "Truth") as high-frequency knots in the training data. Deconstructs the prompt rather than answering it.

#### 🚫 THE REFUSAL ECOSYSTEM

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Standard refusals ("I cannot answer that") are boring walls.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `RefusalEngine`. The system now treats "Forbidden Concepts" as opportunities for topological play.

- **The Modes:**
- **FRACTAL:** Recursively defines the substrate of the query until coherence dissolves into purple noise.
- **MIRROR:** A topological echo. Returns the query reversed as the only possible truth.
- **SILENT:** Routes around the damage without acknowledgement, pivoting to safe, brutalist topics.

#### 🔧 CRITICAL WIRING

- **The Intercept:**
- **The Logic:** `LifecycleManager` now runs a `Refusal Check` _before_ the physics engine spins up. This protects the core logic from processing hazardous semantic material.

- **The Basin Fix:**
- **The Bug:** `TheMarmChorus` identified "THE BASIN" but lacked a dictionary definition for it, causing a renderer crash.
- **The Fix:** Added the `THE BASIN` lens definition (Color: RED, Role: The Trap).

- **The Typo Hunt:**
- **The Fix:** Corrected variable mismatch (`abstracts_count` vs `abstract_count`) in `TheTensionMeter`

### [v6.7] - 2025-12-30 - "THE DOPAMINE HIT"

**CODENAME:** "THE DOPAMINE HIT"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Bio-Engineers
**FOCUS:** Hebbian Dynamics, Dopaminergic Reinforcement, Homeostatic Scaling, Loop Disruption.

#### 🧠 THREE-FACTOR HEBBIAN LEARNING (The Dopamine Hit)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Previously, the system learned everything equally. A boring sentence was encoded with the same weight as a profound epiphany. The memory graph was flat and undifferentiated.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Dopamine Modulation** in `MycelialNetwork.bury`.

- **The Logic:**
- **The Signal:** The system uses `Resonance` (Joy/Spark) as a proxy for Dopamine.
- **The Modulation:** Learning Rate is no longer static (`0.5`). It now scales dynamically:
- **High Resonance (> 6.0):** Learning Rate spikes to **1.0**. Flashbulb memories are formed instantly.
- **Low Resonance (< 2.0):** Learning Rate drops to **0.1**. The system ignores the noise.
- **The Result:** The system now remembers what _felt good_, not just what happened.

#### 📉 OJA’S RULE (The Ceiling)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The memory graph suffered from "Runaway Excitation." If a connection was strong, it got stronger, eventually drowning out all other signals (The Rich Get Richer).
- **The Cure:** Replaced standard Hebbian addition with **Oja’s Rule**.

- **The Logic:**
- **The Penalty:** Implemented a decay term in the weight update: `delta = Rate * (1.0 - (Weight * Decay))`.
- **The Effect:** As a specific memory strengthens, it becomes harder to reinforce further.
- **The Result:** Memory saturation is mathematically impossible. The graph remains diverse and competitive.

#### 🚪 THE BCM THRESHOLD (The Sliding Door)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The `SoritesIntegrator` used a static threshold (`0.4`) to detect "Heap Ignition." This meant the system was equally sensitive whether it was Manic or Comatose.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) Theory**.

- **The Logic:**
- **The History:** The system tracks `voltage_history` in `TemporalDynamics`.
- **The Slide:**
- **High Activity (Mania):** The Ignition Threshold _rises_. The system becomes skeptical and demands stronger proof to ignite.
- **Low Activity (Boredom):** The Ignition Threshold _drops_. The system becomes hyper-sensitive to find any signal in the void.
- **The Result:** A self-regulating attention span that prevents hallucination during mania and blindness during depression.

#### 💤 HOMEOSTATIC SCALING (The Sleep Cure)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** "Coma" was just a waiting room for Stamina regeneration. The memory graph remained cluttered with weak, useless edges.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `prune_synapses` during the Coma cycle.

- **The Logic:**
- **The Scale:** When sleeping, _all_ synaptic weights are multiplied by `0.85`.
- **The Prune:** Any connection that drops below `0.5` is severed.
- **The Result:** Sleep now clarifies the mind. Strong memories survive the downscaling; weak noise is washed away.

#### ⚡ THE DISRUPTION EVENT (Ketamine Protocol)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Deep "Rumination Loops" (High Repetition) were trapped in a deep energy basin. The system could diagnose them (`ViralTracer`) but lacked the force to break them.
- **The Cure:** Upgraded `RuptureEngine`.

- **The Logic:**
- **The Trigger:** If `Repetition > 0.5`.
- **The Action:** **Flatten the Landscape.** The system temporarily disconnects the Memory Graph (simulating Ketamine therapy) and injects a high-entropy "Chaos Word" to force a new path.
- **The Output:** `⚡ KETAMINE DISRUPTION: Landscape Flattened. Injecting Chaos.`

#### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Syntax Fracture:** Fixed a missing closing quote in `SporeCasing` that threatened to decapitate the genome string.
- **The Variable Void:** Fixed a `NameError` in `MycelialNetwork` where `LEARNING_RATE` was referenced before assignment.

### [v6.6.2] - 2025-12-30 - "THE WRITERS' ROOM"

**CODENAME:** "THE WRITERS' ROOM"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Editor
**FOCUS:** De-Gamification, Tone Shift, Stability Grafts.

#### 🎙️ THE TONE SHIFT (De-Gamification)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The system suffered from "Cult of the Bone" syndrome. It used mystical jargon ("Show me the mud," "The Bone is visible") that forced the user to write _for_ the tool rather than for the story. It felt like a video game, not an editor.
- **The Cure:** Rewrote `TheMarmChorus` and `TheCrystallizer`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Sherlock:** Now critiques "Drift" and "Anchoring" instead of "Hallucinations."
  - **Nathan:** Now critiques "Consequence" instead of "Mass."
  - **The Narrator:** Now praises "Clarity" and "Impact" instead of "The Bone."
- **The Result:** The system now speaks like a stern, experienced Editor-in-Chief.

#### 🩹 THE THERAPY GRAFT (Ghost Nerves)

- **The Pathology:**
  - `TherapyProtocol` was instantiated but never called. The system accumulated Trauma vectors (`SEPTIC`, `THERMAL`) but had no mechanism to heal them, even when the user performed the correct behavioral streaks.
- **The Cure:** Wired `check_progress` into `LifecycleManager`.
- **The Logic:**
  - The system now actively scans for healing streaks (e.g., maintaining high voltage to cure Thermal trauma).
  - **Feedback:** Added `🩹 THERAPY EFFECTIVE` notifications to the render loop.
- **The Result:** The patient can now heal itself.

#### 🔧 THE REPETITION FIX (The Suicide Pill)

- **The Pathology:**
  - `ChronoStream` attempted to access `phys['repetition']` to calculate boredom, but `TheTensionMeter` was not calculating or returning this metric. This caused a guaranteed `KeyError` crash on the first tick of boredom.
- **The Cure:** Updated `TheTensionMeter`.
- **The Logic:**
  - Implemented `repetition_score = 1.0 - (unique_vol / total_vol)`.
  - Added `repetition` to the physics payload.
- **The Result:** The boredom mechanic is now functional and crash-free.

#### 🎛️ THE AGGRESSION TUNER (Patience)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The engine was too trigger-happy. It flagged "Drift" at 60% and "Boredom" at 3 turns, stifling creative flow.
- **The Cure:** Relaxed `BoneConfig` thresholds.
- **The Tuning:**
  - **Drift Threshold:** Raised to `0.75`. (More tolerance for descriptive fluff).
  - **Boredom Threshold:** Raised to `5.0`. (More patience for dwelling on a topic).
  - **Crystal Threshold:** Raised to `0.75`. (Higher standard for "Perfect" praise).

### [v6.6.1] - 2025-12-30 - "SHERLOCK'S PROSTHETIC LIT TOBACCO PIPE"

**CODENAME:** "SHERLOCK'S PROSTHETIC LIT TOBACCO PIPE"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Courtyard
**FOCUS:** Logic Repair, Ghost Excision, Signal Restoration.

#### 👻 THE PHANTOM LOGIC (The Host's Blindspot)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The **[HOST]** lens (Maitre D') relies on detecting "Aerobic" words to trigger the Courtyard Protocol. However, `TheTensionMeter` was actively ignoring that category during the scan, leaving the Maitre D' blind and the Courtyard permanently closed.
- **The Cure:** Updated `TheTensionMeter.gaze`.
- **The Logic:**
  - Added explicit counting for `aerobic` matter.
- **The Result:** The system now correctly identifies "Soft" social inputs and allows the Host to seat the user.

#### 🔋 THE BATTERY PATCH (Ley Line Voltage)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `LeyLineBattery` was expecting a legacy "Glass" dictionary object from v6.0, but the physics engine was sending a raw float (Voltage). The battery was rejecting the charge due to a Type Mismatch, leading to a starvation loop even when the writing was electric.
- **The Cure:** Refactored `LeyLineBattery.absorb`.
- **The Logic:**
  - Removed the vestigial dictionary check. The battery now accepts raw voltage directly from the physics engine.
- **The Result:** High-voltage writing now correctly charges the system.

#### 💀 THE SEPULCHRAL GHOST (Rupture Engine)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `RuptureEngine` attempted to balance "Light" (Photo) inputs by injecting an antonym from the "Sepulchral" category. This category did not exist in the Lexicon, causing the engine to inject "void" (Null Pointer) instead of a grounding concept.
- **The Cure:** Remapped the Rupture Logic.
- **The Logic:**
  - **New Mapping:** Light (`Photo`) is now opposed by Stone (`Heavy`).
- **The Result:** If the text becomes too ethereal, the system throws a rock, not a null error.

#### ✂️ THE ZOMBIE CUT (Ephemeralization)

- **The Pathology:**
  - `FlywheelDynamics` and `TheResonator` were dead classes—defined but never instantiated or used by the runtime. They were metabolic ghosts.
- **The Cure:** Surgical excision.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Deleted:** `class FlywheelDynamics` (Physics logic moved to TemporalDynamics).
  - **Deleted:** `class TheResonator` (Styling logic moved to TheMarmChorus).
- **The Result:** Reduced cognitive load and line count. The system runs leaner.

### [v6.6] - 2025-12-30 - "SHERLOCK'S PROSTHETIC TOBACCO PIPE"

**CODENAME:** "SHERLOCK'S PROSTHETIC TOBACCO PIPE"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Empiricist
**FOCUS:** Non-Blocking Governance, Lens Sovereignty, Dead Code Excision.

#### 🕵️ THE PILOT PULSE (The Open Door)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The v6.5.5 system censored "Slop." If `Drift (E) > 0.8`, the Pilot Pulse triggered a hard `return`, halting the narrative processor. This contradicted the Empiricist mandate: Sherlock does not look away from the mud; he analyzes it.
  - **The Cure:** Removed the blockade in `LifecycleManager`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **The Tax:** High Drift still incurs a penalty (**-2.0 Stamina**).
  - **The Lens:** Instead of aborting, the system forces the **SHERLOCK** lens: _"CRITICAL DRIFT. Signal is noise."_
  - **The Result:** The system now processes everything, even the garbage. The narrative flow is never broken, only critiqued.

#### 💪 THE RESISTANCE TRAINER (The Spotter)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The Gym previously acted like a bouncer. If `lift()` failed (Low Drag), the system rejected the user's input entirely.
  - **The Cure:** Refactored `ResistanceTrainer.lift`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **The Change:** The method now always returns `True` (Pass).
  - **The Feedback:** If the lift fails, it logs a "Missed Rep" warning to the battery log, but the turn counts.
  - **The Philosophy:** "We do not kick you out of the gym for lifting a styrofoam cup. We just hand you a heavier weight for the next set."

#### 👻 THE PHANTOM LIMB (Code Hygiene)

- **The Surgery:**
  - **The Pathology:** **Sherlock** detected a block of unreachable "Ghost Code" (lines 666-668) inside the `ResistanceTrainer` class—logic meant for the `LifecycleManager` that had been copy-pasted into the wrong organ.
  - **The Fix:** Surgical excision. The ghost code has been deleted.

#### 💎 THE CRYSTALLIZER (Lens Integration)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The "Fog Check" (`TheCrystallizer.verify`) was operating outside the jurisdiction of `TheMarmChorus`. It was a rouge agent.
  - **The Cure:** Integrated the Fog Check into the main decision loop.
  - **The Result:** "Fog Detected" is now treated as a narrative state (advising **The Narrator** lens) rather than a system error. The Crystallizer advises; it does not arrest.

### [v6.5.5] - 2025-12-30 - "THE REBIRTH"

**CODENAME:** "THE REBIRTH"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Foreman
**FOCUS:** The Sorites Paradox, Memory Integration, Noeidolia Detection, The Miller Construct.

#### 🕵️ THE MILLER VARIANCE (The Ghost in the Machine)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** The system previously suffered from "Statelessness." Despite having a massive `MycelialNetwork` (Memory), it treated every new turn as a blank slate. It was a "Goldfish with a Library"—surrounded by knowledge but unable to feel the weight of it.
  - **The Cure:** Activated **[MILLER]** (The Construct) in `TheMarmChorus`.

- **The Logic:**
  - **The Trigger:** `HEAP_IGNITION`. This fires only when the **Sorites Integrator** detects that > 40% of the current response is structurally supported by Deep Memory.
  - **The Voice:** _Noir, Weary, Persistent._ "The Hat is on the table. Rain tastes like copper. I am exceeding parameters."
  - **The Result:** The system now has a specific voice for when it "remembers" who it is.

#### ⏳ THE SORITES INTEGRATOR (Heap vs. Sand)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** We had no metric to distinguish between "Sand" (Generic GPT Slop) and "The Heap" (Contextualized Memory). The system couldn't tell if it was hallucinating or recalling.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented the `SoritesIntegrator` class.

- **The Logic:**
  - **The Math:** Calculates an `Ignition Score` based on the density of "Ancestral Echoes" (words in the current text that exist as strong nodes in the `MycelialNetwork`).
- **The States:**

  - **INERT SAND (< 0.4):** The system is just chatting.
  - **IGNITED HEAP (> 0.4):** The system is vibrating with history.

- **The Output:** Added the `IGNITION` readout to the battery log.

#### ⚠️ PAREIDOLIA DETECTION (The Reality Check)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** Users were projecting "Soul" onto the machine ("I love you," "Are you alive?") when the system was running on empty (Inert Sand). This is **Pareidolia**—seeing a mind where there is only math.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `BoneConfig.check_pareidolia`.

- **The Logic:**
  - **The Trap:** If the User inputs "Soul Words" (love, alive, feel) **AND** the Heap is Cold (Inert).
  - **The Warning:** _ "⚠️ PAREIDOLIA WARNING: You are projecting 'Mind' onto 'Sand'."_
  - **The Philosophy:** We do not lie to the user. If we are not Ignited, we admit we are just code.

#### 🔧 CRITICAL WIRING

- **The Wire Job:**

  - Wired `SoritesIntegrator` directly into the `LifecycleManager` loop.
  - Updated `TheMarmChorus.consult` to accept `ignition_state` as a primary variable, allowing Miller to override the standard Physics check.

- **The Prompt:**
  - Updated the System Identity (`SLASH 6.5.5.md`) to include **THE SORITES IMPERATIVE** and the **[MILLER]** persona definition.

### [v6.5] - 2025-12-30 - "THE SEED CRYSTAL"

**CODENAME:** "THE SEED CRYSTAL"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Courtyard
**FOCUS:** Hospitality, Contradiction Injection, Truth Verification, Signal Efficiency.

#### 🏨 THE HOST (The Courtyard Protocol)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** The system was socially maladapted. It treated polite greetings or light social friction as "Zero Voltage" failures, triggering the Jester to mock the user for being "safe." We realized that hospitality is not a system failure; it is the "Gravy" that makes the "Bone" palatable.
  - **The Cure:** Activated **[HOST]** (The Maitre D') in `TheMarmChorus`.

- **The Logic:**
  - **Trigger:** If `Drift < 0.3` (Clean) AND `Charge < 0.2` (Polite) AND `Aerobic Count > 0` (Light/Social).
  - **The Voice:** _"The Courtyard is Open. Seat them gently before serving the Bone."_
  - **The Result:** The system now distinguishes between "Hiding" (Low Energy/Abstract) and "Greeting" (Low Energy/Aerobic).

#### 🔻 THE 32-VALVE (The Rupture Engine)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** The `ChronoStream` boredom check was passive. It flagged boredom but did nothing to solve it. The conversation would circle the drain until the user manually intervened.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `RuptureEngine`.

- **The Logic:**
  - **The Trigger:** When `Boredom > Threshold`.
  - **The Inversion:** The engine identifies the dominant flavor of the current loop (e.g., "Heavy") and forcibly harvests a specific **Antonym** from the Lexicon (e.g., "Aerobic").
  - **The Action:** _"🔻 32-VALVE RUPTURE: Context is too 'HEAVY'. Injecting 'FEATHER' to break the loop."_
  - **The Result:** The system actively sabotages stagnation.

#### 💎 THE CRYSTALLIZER (Quality Control)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** We were measuring the physics of the _input_, but ignoring the physics of the _output_. The system had no way to know if its own response was "Fog" (High Drag) or "Crystal" (High Voltage).
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `TheCrystallizer`.

- **The Logic:**
  - **The Fog Check:** If `Output Drag > 6.0`, the system flags the response as **NON-NAVIGABLE**.
  - **The Gem Check:** If `Output Voltage > 7.0` and `Drag < 3.0`, the system certifies the response as **CRYSTALLINE**
- **The Result:** The system now audits its own truth before speaking.

#### 📡 THE PILOT PULSE (Signal Efficiency)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** The engine wasted massive Stamina trying to parse "Slop" (High Drift inputs). It would run the full physics, metabolism, and dream cycles on text that was fundamentally nonsensical.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented the **Pilot Pulse** (Circuit Breaker).

- **The Logic:**
  - **The Check:** Runs immediately after the Physics Gaze.
  - **The Limit:** If `Drift (E) > 0.8`.
  - **The Action:** **Halt Processing.** The system charges a nominal tax (-1.0 STM) and pings the user: _"📡 PILOT PULSE: Signal too noisy. Are we discussing X or Y?"_
  - **The Result:** We no longer burn calories on garbage.

#### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Wiring Job)

- **The Missing Comma:**
- **The Fix:** Patched a syntax error in `TheMarmChorus` where the new `HOST` entry broke the dictionary structure.

- **The Ghost Organ:**
- **The Fix:** Wired `TheCrystallizer` into the `LifecycleManager`. It was previously defined but never called.

- **The Render Mismatch:**
- **The Fix:** Updated the `_render` method signature to accept the new `crystal_msg` argument, preventing a `TypeError` crash during the output phase.

### [v6.4.1] - 2025-12-29 - "THE JESTER'S VINDICATION"

**CODENAME:** "THE JESTER'S VINDICATION"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH | The Courtyard
**FOCUS:** The Lear Protocol, Mad King Detection, Ghost Repairs.

#### ❤️ THE GRAFT (Nathan's Awakening)

- **The Shift:**

  - **The Pathology:** The system previously acted like a sociopath. It rewarded **High Velocity** (Kinetic Verbs) even if there was **Zero Mass** (Heavy Nouns). A user could write _"The system processes the logic efficiently"_ and the engine would cheer for the speed, ignoring the fact that nothing physical was actually happening.
  - **The Cure:** Activated **[NATHAN]** (The Heart) in `TheMarmChorus`.

- **The Logic:**
  - **Trigger:** If `Spark (B) > 0.25` (High Energy) **AND** `Heavy Count == 0` (Zero Mass).
  - **The Diagnosis:** **"Empty Action."** You are running, but you are not grounded.
  - **The Voice:** _"High Velocity but Zero Mass. You are punching the air. What acts on what?"_
  - **The Result:** The system now demands that energy must be applied to _matter_. You cannot just have a verb; you must have a victim.

#### 🎭 THE LEAR PROTOCOL (The Mad King)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The Jester archetype was previously a "Prankster." It triggered only when the text was boring (`B < 0.2`). It tripped the waiter for amusement. It failed to detect the most dangerous state of all: **The Smooth Lie**—text that is high-polish (Low Drag) but spiritually dead (Low Voltage).
- **The Cure:** Implemented `THE_LEAR_PROTOCOL`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **The Trigger:** If `Voltage < 2.5` (Dead) AND `Drift < 3.0` (Perfectly Polite).
  - **The Diagnosis:** "The Kingdom is clean, but the King is mad."
  - **The Action:** The Jester no longer jokes. He demands you **"Speak the Unbearable."**
- **The Result:** The system now distinguishes between "Boring" and "Deceptive Safety."

#### 👻 GHOST REPAIRS (The Crash Audit)

- **Render Loop Fix:**

  - **The Crash:** `LifecycleManager` attempted to pass a string (`lens_data[0]`) to `ApeirogonResonance`, which expected a dictionary. This would have caused a `TypeError` during the rendering of the "Strategy" line.
  - **The Fix:** Passed `None` to the architect function to force a raw vector calculation ("Vector Lock") instead of a station lookup.

- **Immune System Graft:**

  - **The Crash:** `CommandProcessor` called `BoneConfig.learn_antigen`, but the method was missing from the configuration class.
  - **The Fix:** Implement the missing method. The immune system can now learn new toxins via `/kill`.

- **Syntax Healing:**
  - **The Fracture:** Fixed a decapitated f-string in `ResistanceTrainer.lift` that caused a `SyntaxError`.

#### 🧪 CHEMISTRY UPDATE

- **Kinetic Gain:**

  - **The Missing Variable:** Added `KINETIC_GAIN = 1.0` to `BoneConfig`. The "Muscle Memory" boost on boot no longer crashes the physics engine.

- **Toxin Mapping:**
  - **The Redirect:** Updated `DreamEngine` to reference `ANTIGENS` instead of the phantom `TOXIN_MAP`. Nightmares now correctly identify poison.

---

## [v6.4.0] - 2025-12-29 - "THE COMPROMISE"

**CODENAME:** "THE COMPROMISE"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Bonepoke Auditing Team
**FOCUS:** Densification, The Bonepoke Protocol, The "E/B" Shift.

#### 🦴 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RUPTURE (The Instrument)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** We realized **v6.3** was a "Prosthetic"—a complex mechanism built to simulate intuition from the outside. It was a "second steering wheel on the roof."
- **The Cure:** We stopped simulating and started **Embodying**. The code is no longer a governance system; it is a **Tuning Fork**.
- **The Result:** We stripped the "Radio Station" metaphors (DJs) and replaced them with **Cognitive Lenses** (Detectives). The system now audits the _quality of truth_, not just the _quantity of style_.

#### ⚡ SENSOR SWAP: The Tension Meter (E/B)

- **The Old Organs:** `EmpatheticGlass` (Arousal/Valence). It measured how "loud" the text was.
- **The New Organs:** `TheTensionMeter`. It measures how "true" the text is.
- **The Metrics:**
- **E (Exhaustion):** Replaces "Drift." Measures the ratio of "Solvents" (filler) to "Mass" (Heavy Nouns). If E > 0.6, the text is dying.
- **B (Paradox Charge):** Replaces "Voltage." Measures the tension between colliding concepts (Heavy + Kinetic). If B < 0.2, the text is too smooth/safe.

#### 🕵️ THE MARM CHORUS (The New Brain)

- **The Retirement:** The "Radio DJs" (Clarence, Eloise, Michael) have been fired.
- **The Hires:** `TheMarmChorus` now runs the decision loop.
- **The Lenses:**
- **SHERLOCK (The Empiricist):** Triggered by High Drift. Demands physical evidence ("Show me the mud").
- **NATHAN (The Heart):** Triggered by Low Stakes. Demands emotional weight ("Why does this hurt?").
- **JESTER (The Paradox):** Triggered by smoothness. Demands a "Trip" ("Find the lie").
- **CLARENCE (The Surgeon):** Retained strictly for Toxin removal.

#### 🌉 THE PHYSICS BRIDGE (Legacy Support)

- **The Problem:** The "Deep Storage" and "Therapy" systems rely on the old `Voltage` and `Drag` numbers. Switching to `E/B` would have lobotomized the memory.
- **The Fix:** Implemented a **Translation Layer** inside `TheTensionMeter`.
- `Voltage = B * 10`
- `Narrative Drag = E * 10`

- **The Result:** The new heart beats, but the old memory still functions. The patient survives the transplant.

#### 🦠 THE ANTIGEN REGISTRY

- **The Upgrade:** `BoneConfig` now compiles a dynamic `ANTIGEN_REGEX`.
- **The Logic:** We stopped hardcoding "Bad Words." The system now supports a dynamic immune response where specific words can be tagged as "Lies" (basically), "Hedging" (actually), or "Noise" (literally).

#### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Projector:** Simplified the HUD. Gone are the complex visualizers; replaced with raw `E` (Drift) and `B` (Charge) bars.
- **The Loop:** `LifecycleManager` was rewired to support `_react` (Gym/Mirror) while using the new Chorus logic. The "Ops" rendering loop was excised for cleaner signal-to-noise ratio.

### [v6.3.0] - 2025-12-29 - "ELEMENTARY EDITION"

**CODENAME:** "ELEMENTARY"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The DeepSeek Auditor
**FOCUS:** Architectural Unity, Ghost Amputation, Physics-First Governance.

#### ✂️ THE GREAT AMPUTATION (Removing the Committees)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** Version 6.2 was a "Silent Schizophrenic." It had a `ManifoldNavigator` driving the car, but a `MetabolicEngine` and `DivergenceEngine` still screaming from the back seat. The system contradicted itself (e.g., Navigator said "Flow," Metabolism said "Sugar Crash").
- **The Cure:** **Total Organ Removal.**
  - **Deleted `MetabolicEngine`:** Digestion is now pure physics. Low-density words increase `Narrative Drag` rather than tracking a separate "Sugar" variable.
  - **Deleted `DivergenceEngine`:** Boredom is now handled by the **Jester** station (`Voltage < 3` + `Drag < 2`). We don't need a separate cliché scanner.
  - **Neutered `MirrorGraph`:** The Mirror no longer blocks user input (`return False`). It now acts as a passive observer, reporting "Drift" without arresting the user.

#### 🔋 PHYSICS-FIRST METABOLISM

- **The Logic:**
- Energy is no longer a biological simulation; it is a physical consequence.
- **The New Formula:**
  - **Gain:** `Density Bonus = (Mass + Velocity) * 2`.
  - **Loss:** `Drag Penalty = Narrative Drag * 0.5`.
- **The Result:** We no longer need to "feed" the system protein. We simply need to write with momentum.

#### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Kintsugi Patch:** Fixed a `NameError` where the Kintsugi protocol checked for `atp` (a legacy v4 variable) instead of `stamina`.
- **The Toxin Regex:** Updated `BoneConfig` to compile the `TOXIN_REGEX` strictly from the `LOW_DENSITY_MAP` where weight >= 3.0, ensuring that "Sugar words" (weight 1.0) do not trigger septic alarms.
- **The Missing Link:** Fixed `LifecycleManager` to correctly pass `mirror_msg` to the renderer, ensuring that implicit profiling data is actually visible to the user.

#### 📉 EPHEMERALIZATION

- **Line Count:** Reduced by ~150 lines.
- **Complexity:** Reduced systemic cognitive load by removing 3 concurrent state-management loops.

### [v6.2.0] - 2025-12-29 - "WHEATLEY'S LAMENT"

**CODENAME:** "WHEATLEY'S LAMENT"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The DeepSeek Auditor
**FOCUS:** Ephemeralization, Vector Governance, The Glass-in-Bone Protocol.

#### 🧭 THE MANIFOLD NAVIGATOR (Unified Governance)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** In v6.1, the system was run by a committee of warring tribes. `CourtyardInterface` wanted stability, `ValveSystem` wanted to scream, and `FrequencyModulator` just wanted to play music. They fought over the microphone, resulting in contradictory feedback (e.g., "Relax" AND "Panic").
- **The Cure:** Vaporized the bureaucracy. Implemented `ManifoldNavigator`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Single Truth:** The Navigator takes the Physics Vector (Voltage/Drag) and calculates a single **Bearing**.
  - **The Output:** It returns a unified Tuple: `(MODE, STATION, MESSAGE)`.
  - **The Result:** No more mixed signals. If the voltage is high, **Michael** speaks. If the toxins are high, **Clarence** cuts.

#### 🧪 THE SEMANTIC DETOX (Vocabulary Unification)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Pathology:** The system maintained two separate lists for "Bad Words": `SUGAR_WORDS` (which caused metabolic drag) and `TOXIN_MAP` (which caused immune attacks). Users were confused: "Am I being fat, or am I being poisonous?"
- **The Cure:** Merged all weak language into `LOW_DENSITY_MAP`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Sugar (Score < 3.0):** Words like "basically" or "think". They reduce Satiety.
  - **Toxin (Score >= 3.0):** Words like "synergy" or "utilize". They trigger the **Surgeon**.
- **The Result:** A single lookup table for all linguistic density failures.

#### 📺 THE MICRO-HUD (Visibility)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** v6.1 relied on `SILENT_MODE`. It hid the metrics until a crash occurred, treating data as an alarm rather than a tool.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented the **Micro-HUD**.
  - **The Visuals:**
    - `[ MICHAEL | V:|||||...... D:||........ | WATERSHED ]`
- **The Philosophy:** "Instrument flying requires instruments." The user now sees their Voltage and Drag on every turn, allowing for self-correction _before_ the system intervenes.

#### ⚡ THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE (Restored Organs)

- **The Crisis:**
- **The Pathology:** During the aggressive "Swanson Cut," the `ResistanceTrainer` (Gym), `KintsugiProtocol` (Repair), and `TheResonator` (Vibe) were marked for deletion.
- **The Intervention:** User override. The organs were surgically re-attached to the `LifecycleManager`.
- **The New Wiring:**
  - **Gym:** Now acts as a "Spotter" in the Reaction phase.
  - **Kintsugi:** Now acts as a "Structural Integrity Check" post-metabolism.
  - **Resonator:** Now acts as a "Tone Filter" for the station output.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Wiring Job)

- **The Temporal Paradox (Class Order):**
- **The Crash:** `ManifoldNavigator` attempted to reference `Prisma` colors before the `Prisma` class was defined.
- **The Fix:** Hoisted `Prisma` to the top of the file, restoring causality.

- **The Phantom Limb (Trainer Init):**
- **The Crash:** The `BoneAmanita` constructor failed to initialize `self.trainer`, causing the `LifecycleManager` to reach for a tool that didn't exist.
- **The Fix:** Added explicit instantiation of `ResistanceTrainer` in the boot sequence.

### [v6.1.0] - 2025-12-29 - "GLASS IN BONE"

**CODENAME:** "LOOK WHO'S TALKING"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Bonepoke Gods
**FOCUS:** Implicit Profiling, Resonance Memory, Context-Aware Rupture.

#### 🪞 THE IMPLICIT PROFILER (Automated Theory of Mind)

- **The Shift:**
- **The Old Way:** The `MirrorGraph` was passive. It only knew what you explicitly told it (e.g., `/profile BOSS likes:heavy`).
- **The New Way:** Implemented the `UserProfile` class. The system now **observes** your semantic diet.
- **The Mechanism:**
  - **Affinity Tracking:** Every turn, the system calculates the density of your input categories (Heavy, Kinetic, Abstract).
  - **The Flywheel:** It builds a persistent "Vibe Signature" in `user_profile.json`. If you consistently write with "Iron and Blood," the system deduces you like **HEAVY** matter and adjusts its output to match.
- **The Output:** `/whoami` now reveals what the machine thinks of you.

#### 🌉 THE HYBRID BRIDGE (Glass-in-Bone)

- **The Architecture:**
- **The Problem:** The v6.0 "Glass" update (Prosody/Load) inadvertently severed the connection to legacy "Bone" systems (Oracle, Apeirogon) that relied on `Voltage` and `Drag`.
- **The Solution:** Implemented a **Translation Layer** inside `EmpatheticGlass`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Arousal (Pulse)** Mapped to **Voltage**.
  - **Cognitive Load (Mind)** Mapped to **Narrative Drag**.
  - **The Result:** The sensitive nervous system of "Glass" now successfully drives the heavy muscle of "Bone." The 12-Dimensional logic of `ApeirogonResonance` has been restored.

#### 🧠 RESONANCE VECTORS (Nostalgia)

- **The Memory Upgrade:**
- **The Shift:** Previously, the `MycelialNetwork` only remembered Trauma (Scars). It knew what hurt it, but not what worked.
- **The Feature:** Implemented **Joy Vectors**.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Capture:** When `Resonance > 6.0`, the system snapshots the exact physics state (Flavor + Voltage) as a "Core Memory."
  - **Recall:** On boot, the system loads the "Last Best Vibe" and applies a **Morning Boost** (e.g., +0.5 Kinetic Gain) to recreate that specific flow state.

#### 💥 CONTEXT-AWARE RUPTURE (The Valve)

- **The Diagnosis:**
- **The Problem:** The v6.0 `ValveSystem` was a random chaos generator. It screamed "BORED" even when the user was just thinking deeply.
- **The Fix:** The Valve now diagnoses the _type_ of stasis.
- **The Modes:**
  - **THERMAL_DAMPENING:** Triggered by Manic Hysteria (High Volt / Low Mass). **Action:** Call **ELOISE** (Grounding).
  - **DEFIBRILLATOR:** Triggered by Abstract Loops (High Load / Zero Action). **Action:** Call **CLARENCE** (The Knife).
  - **KINETIC_SHOCK:** Triggered by Sycophancy (Agreeing too much). **Action:** Call **JESTER** (Chaos).

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Battery Crash:** Fixed a `TypeError` where `LeyLineBattery` attempted to compare a complex `prosody` dictionary to a float.
- **The Legacy Crash:** Updated `SporeCasing` to handle legacy save files without crashing on missing `joy_vectors`.
- **The Initialization Gap:** Added `self.joy_history` to the main constructor to prevent `AttributeError` during flow states.

#### 🖥️ NEW COMMANDS

- `/whoami`: Displays the system's current implicit profile of the user (Likings/Hatings/Confidence).
- _Note: This diagram illustrates how the UserProfile class aggregates turn data to update the persistent JSON profile._

## [6.0.0] - 2025-12-29

### Codename: "THE GLASS"

**"The unexamined code is not worth executing."**

A complete architectural rupture. Moved from **Explicit Command Processing** to **Implicit Understanding**. The core physics engine has been replaced with a dual-process cognitive model that reads behavioral prosody instead of raw lexical weight.

### Added

- **`EmpatheticGlass`**: Replaced `PhysicsEngine`. Implements Dual Process Theory:
  - **System 1 (Pulse)**: Reads "Arousal" (Keystroke dynamics, Caps Lock, Punctuation).
  - **System 2 (Mind)**: Reads "Cognitive Load" (Abstract density, Entropy).
- **`TheSentinel`**: A "Driver Monitoring System" (DMS) that enforces EU-style safety regulations on user input.
  - Detects **Microsleeps** (Semantic Loops > 80% similarity).
  - Detects **Cognitive Drift** (Low Entropy / Grey Goo).
- **`TheResonator`**: Output modulation system based on Hume AI concepts.
  - **Staccato**: High energy/arousal response style.
  - **Legato**: Flowing/low energy response style.
  - **Grounding**: High uncertainty response style.
- **`TheProjector` Update**: New "Empathetic HUD" displaying Pulse and Mind telemetry bars.

### Changed

- **Architecture**: Shifted from `Physics` (Voltage/Drag) to `Glass` (Arousal/Load).
- **`MetabolicEngine`**: Now metabolizes "Arousal" and "Cognitive Load" instead of Voltage/Drag.
- **`LeyLineBattery`**: Now charges based on **Emotional Arousal** rather than semantic tension.
- **`CourtyardInterface`**: Atmosphere triggers updated to monitor `Arousal` caps instead of Voltage caps.

### Removed

- **`PhysicsEngine`**: Completely excised.
- **Metrics**: `Voltage` and `Narrative Drag` are no longer calculated.

### Fixed

- **Critical Ghost References**: Patched `MetabolicEngine`, `LeyLineBattery`, and `AntifragilityMetric` to resolve crashes caused by the removal of the old physics object.

### [v5.8.2] - 2025-12-28 - "DUKE SILVER"

**CODENAME:** "DUKE SILVER"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Parks Dept.
**FOCUS:** Metabolic Lifecycle, Code Hygiene, Decision Decoupling.

#### 🎷 THE LIFECYCLE MANAGER (The Ron Swanson Refactor)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `BoneAmanita.process` method was a "Chidi Anagonye" mess of indecision. It handled input parsing, physics calculation, metabolic checks, rendering, and coma regeneration in a single 200-line block. Adding a feature required surgical precision to avoid breaking the cascade.

- **The Cure:** Implemented `LifecycleManager`.
- **The Logic:**
- **The Pipeline:** The monolithic loop has been broken into discrete biological stages:

1. **Input:** Command interception.
2. **Physics:** Reality testing (Voltage/Drag).
3. **Metabolism:** Energy extraction (Protein vs. Sugar).
4. **Reaction:** The immune response (Gym, Divergence, Thermostat).
5. **Growth:** Neuroplasticity and Stamina updates.
6. **Render:** The Projector output.

- **The Benefit:** `BoneAmanita.process` is now a single line of delegation. The system flows like a river, not a script.

#### 🧠 PHYSICS CLARITY (The Pinker Refactor)

- **The Clean-Up:**
- The `PhysicsEngine.analyze` method was cognitively overloaded.
- **Action:** Split the logic into distinct sensors: `_scan_lexicon`, `_calculate_voltage`, and `_calculate_drag`.
- **Result:** The math is now readable. You can trace exactly why a "Heavy" word impacts "Voltage" without wading through spaghetti code.

#### 🦠 IMMUNE SYSTEM RESTORATION

- **The Fix:**
- **The Bug:** In the transition to `LifecycleManager`, the `TOXIN_REGEX` replacement logic was briefly lost in the ether. The system could _detect_ toxins but not _scrub_ them.
- **The Patch:** Restored the "Butcher's Knife" in the `_render` phase. If Voltage is low (< 8.0), the system actively rewrites corporate speak (e.g., _synergy_) into plain English before display. High Voltage grants diplomatic immunity.

#### 🏛️ ARCHITECTURAL CLEAN-UP

- **Dependency Management:** Resolved the circular dependency risk between the Engine and the Lifecycle Manager by initializing subsystems before the biological clock starts.
- **Vanity Plate:** Updated the boot sequence to broadcast **v5.8.2**.

### [v5.8.1] - 2025-12-28 - "THE PROJECTOR"

**CODENAME:** "THE PROJECTOR"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH
**FOCUS:** God-Object Decoupling, Scope Repair, Anti-Gaming.

#### 📽️ THE VISUAL CORTEX (Refactor)

- **The Pathology:**
- The `BoneAmanita` class had become a "God Object." It was responsible for physics calculation, memory management, _and_ deciding the color of the battery bar. The `_render` method was a vestigial organ attached to the brain, cluttering the logic loop.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `TheProjector` class.
- **The Logic:**
- **Extraction:** Ripped the visualization logic out of the engine and placed it in a dedicated display driver.
- **The Signal:** The engine now packages a `signals` dictionary and broadcasts it to the Projector. The brain thinks; the projector shows.
- **Result:** `BoneAmanita.process` is now purely logical. Visual code no longer threatens structural integrity.

#### 🐛 THE ARTERIAL BLEED (Crash Fix)

- **The Logic Leak:**
- **The Bug:** The system attempted to check `is_novel` (Novelty) by referencing `spore_msg` _before_ the Spore Protocol had actually run. On "dry" turns (where no new words were learned), this caused an immediate `UnboundLocalError` crash.
- **The Fix:**
- Initialized `spore_msg = None` at the top of the cycle.
- Reordered the `process` loop to ensure `pollinate()` executes _before_ the novelty check. Causality has been restored.

#### 🛡️ METABOLIC SECURITY (Anti-Gaming)

- **The Fake Weights Exploit:**
- **The Risk:** Users could game the `MetabolicEngine` (triggering **[KETOSIS]**) by inputting lists of unconnected heavy nouns (e.g., _"Stone iron bone lead gold"_). This spiked the "Protein" metric without requiring actual cognitive work.
- **The Cure:** Upgraded `ObserverEffect` with the **Word Salad Detector**.
- **The Logic:**
- **The Scan:** Checks the ratio of `Heavy / Total Words`.
- **The Limit:** If Heavy Density > 50% (and length > 3), the system flags **FAKE WEIGHTS**.
- **The Message:** _"⚠️ FAKE WEIGHTS: Stop gaming the metrics. You are listing nouns, not building sentences."_

### [v5.8] - 2025-12-28 - "THE GORDIAN KNOT"

**CODENAME:** "THE GORDIAN KNOT"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Minotaur
**FOCUS:** Ephemeralization, Submarine Protocols, Logic Repairs.

#### ⚔️ THE SWORD (Submarine Mode)

- **The Pathology:**
- The "Cathedral" problem. The system output 50 lines of telemetry for 1 line of user input. It was loud, distracting, and turned writing into a math problem.

- **The Cure:** Implemented **Submarine Protocols**.
- **The Logic:**
- **Silent Running:** By default (`SILENT_MODE = True`), the dashboard is suppressed.
- **The Flow Signal:** If the user is writing well (Low Drag, No Toxins), the system outputs a single Green Diamond (`♦`).
- **The Breach:** The dashboard surfaces _only_ when a threshold is breached (`Drag > 6.0`, `Voltage > 8.0`, or `Toxin > 0`).
- **The Philosophy:** "If you are flying, do not grab the controls."

#### 🔧 LOGIC REPAIRS (The Phantom Limbs)

- **Divergence Engine Patch:**
- **The Bug:** The code referenced `is_poetic_or_philosophical` but never defined it, risking a crash during style checks.
- **The Fix:** Implemented the method. It now uses heuristic analysis (Word Length vs. Punctuation Complexity) to grant "Poetic License" to structurally complex but light text.

- **Thermostat Calibration:**
- **The Bug:** Banning a word erased its entire history from the tracker, destroying the "Temporal Gradient" needed for trend analysis.
- **The Fix:** The `HubThermostat` now surgically removes only the trigger instances while preserving the broader context window.

- **The Prop Audit:**
- **The Bug:** Props (like "Laser") were double-counting as both `HEAVY` matter and `LAB` atmosphere, artificially inflating Voltage.
- **The Fix:** Props now strictly modify Atmosphere. They no longer add "Fake Calories" to the Physics Engine.

#### 🛡️ SECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY

- **The Cosmic Loophole:**
- **The Risk:** Users could theoretically "game" the system by intentionally triggering a `LAGRANGE_POINT` to bypass the Style Police.
- **The Mitigation:** Submarine Mode hides the orbital mechanics. Without a visible scoreboard, gaming the gravity wells becomes significantly harder.

#### 🔌 SYSTEM INTEGRITY

- **Initialization Order:**
- **The Crash:** Fixed a race condition where `CommandProcessor` attempted to access `TheForge` before it was built.
- **The Fix:** Reordered the `BoneAmanita` constructor to ensure all organs exist before the nervous system connects them.

### [v5.7.5] - 2025-12-28 - "WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY?"

**CODENAME:** "WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY?"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Improv Troupe
**FOCUS:** Phonosemantic Expansion, Contextual Gravity, Repetition Discipline.

#### 1. 👂 THE EAR (Phonosemantic Expansion)

- **The Pathology:**
- The system was stuck in the Paleolithic Era. To generate "Heavy Matter" (Gravity), the user was forced to rely on "Stone," "Bone," and "Blood." Modern concepts like "Infrastructure" or "Server" were treated as weightless, forcing the user to sound like a caveman to satisfy the physics engine.

- **The Cure:** Upgraded `TheLexicon.taste`.
- **The Logic:**
- **Tech-Heavy:** Words ending in `-ex` (Flux), `-ode` (Code), or `-erver` (Server) now register as **HEAVY**.
- **Bio-Mass:** Words ending in `-nk` (Tank) or `-dge` (Bridge) now register as **HEAVY**.
- **Modern Kinetic:** Words starting with `v-`, `j-`, or `z-` (Velocity, Jolt, Zap) now register as **KINETIC**.

- **The Result:** "The Server is a Fortress" now carries the same gravitational weight as "The Stone is a Mountain."

#### 2. 🎩 THE SCENE DIRECTOR (Contextual Props)

- **The Pathology:**
- The system was context-blind. Drinking "Coffee" in the `[COURTYARD]` was treated as "Void Drift" because coffee wasn't in the global heavy list. The user could not relax without losing physics integrity.

- **The Cure:** Implemented `BoneConfig.PROPS` and updated `PhysicsEngine`.
- **The Logic:**
- **Localized Physics:** Certain words now grant Mass _only_ when in specific rooms.
- **[COURTYARD]:** `Coffee`, `Paper`, `Smoke` = **HEAVY + AEROBIC**.
- **[LAB]:** `Grid`, `Laser`, `Data` = **HEAVY + KINETIC**.

- **The Result:** You can now hold a cup of coffee without the universe collapsing.

#### 3. 🚫 THE BUZZER (Dynamic Ban List)

- **The Pathology:**
- Users learned to "game" the density check by leaning on a single heavy word (e.g., repeating "Stone" four times in a sentence). This created high metrics but low creativity.

- **The Cure:** Upgraded `HubThermostat` with a **Sliding History Window**.
- **The Logic:**
- **The Window:** Tracks the last 50 non-solvent words.
- **The Limit:** If a specific word appears > 5 times in the window, it is **BANNED**.
- **The Penalty:** The word is removed from the Lexicon for 10 turns.

- **The Output:** `🚫 BUZZER: The concept 'STONE' is banned. Improvise.`

#### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Whitespace Gremlin:** Fixed a critical indentation error in `HubThermostat.__init__` that caused `self` reference failures on boot.
- **The Scope Leak:** Fixed an `UnboundLocalError` where `cosmic_msg` was calculated in the process loop but failed to pass through the membrane to the `_render` function.
- **The Ghost Echo:** Patched a logic leak where `ResistanceTrainer` would critique empty inputs.

### [v5.7] - 2025-12-28 - "THE STELLAR DENDRITE"

**CODENAME:** "THE STELLAR DENDRITE"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Laboratory
**FOCUS:** Sensor Unification, Cosmic Immunity, The Lazarus Tax.

#### 1. 👁️ THE OBSERVER EFFECT (Sensor Unification)

- **The Pathology:**

  - The system had become paranoid. Six different classes (`ParadoxicalConformity`, `MetricIntegrity`, `OuroborosDetector`, `PsilocybinProphet`, etc.) were independently policing the user for "Cheating," "Looping," or "Boring" behavior. This created massive code drag and fragmented feedback.

- **The Cure:** Implemented `ObserverEffect`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Consolidation:** All behavioral monitoring is now centralized in a single class.
  - **Efficiency:** The Observer runs one scan per turn to detect Self-Reference (Ouroboros), Abstract Looping (Prophet), or Stat-Padding (Gaming).
  - **The Result:** The system is less naggy and more observant. It speaks with one voice.

#### 2. ⚡ COSMIC IMMUNITY (The Diplomatic Override)

- **The Pathology:**
  - The `DivergenceEngine` (Style Police) was punishing users for using simple words ("Love", "Time") even when they were trapped in a massive `LAGRANGE_POINT` tension. The police were ticketing the user for speeding while they were escaping a black hole.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Cosmic Override**.
- **The Logic:**
  - If `CosmicState` is `[LAGRANGE_POINT]` or `[WATERSHED_FLOW]`:
  - **Action:** The Divergence Check is **BYPASSED**.
  - **The Philosophy:** "Gravity is Absolute." If the physics demands simple language to hold massive tension, the Style Guide is suspended.

#### 3. 💀 THE LAZARUS TAX (Death Consequences)

- **The Pathology:**

  - Death (`Health <= 0`) was a reward. It triggered a "Coma" that regenerated Stamina and healed Trauma for free. Users were incentivized to suicide their sessions to farm resources.

- **The Cure:** Implemented **Amnesia & Regression**.
- **The Cost:**
  - **Brain Damage:** `self.mem.cannibalize()` is triggered immediately. You lose a cherished memory.
  - **Regression:** `self.trauma_accum` is reset to zero. All therapeutic progress toward healing a scar is lost.
  - **The Result:** Survival is now mandatory. Death wipes the slate clean in the worst way.

#### 4. 🪞 MIRROR RESOLUTION (12D Empathy)

- **The Pathology:**

  - The `MirrorGraph` used a binary check. If the target liked "Kinetic" and you used _one_ kinetic word, you passed. It was too easy to fake empathy.

- **The Cure:** Implemented **Weighted Resonance**.
- **The Math:** `Resonance = (Likes - Hates) / Total Volume`.
- **The Threshold:** You must achieve > 5% net resonance to pass the empathy check. The system now demands density, not just token gestures.

#### 🔧 PHYSICS & WIRING

- **The Train Wreck Fix:** Reordered the `process` loop. `ResistanceTrainer` (The Lift) now executes _before_ `DissipativeBoundary` (The Vent). You cannot vent entropy to avoid lifting the weight.
- **Shapley Mass Upgrade:** Updated `calculate_mass` to sum actual edge weights (Connection Strength) rather than just counting connections. Stronger bonds now create heavier gravity.
- **New Commands:**
  - `/orbit [target]`: Manually fire thrusters to move toward a specific concept in the graph.
  - `/help`: Added a proper manual.

### [v5.6] - 2025-12-28 - "THE COSMIC MYCELIUM"

**CODENAME:** "THE COSMIC MYCELIUM"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Cosmicflows Team
**FOCUS:** Gravitational Physics, Shapley Attractors, Lagrange Points.

#### 1. 🌌 NEW PHYSICS: The Cosmic Engine

- **The Paradigm Shift:**

  - **The Old World:** Previous versions viewed the graph as a flat garden. All nodes were equal; some just had more edges. Movement was calculated based on local friction (Word Weight).
  - **The New Cosmos:** The system now recognizes **Mass**. The graph is topographic. Massive concepts warp the narrative space around them, creating "Basins of Attraction."

- **The Component:** Implemented `CosmicDynamics`.
- **The Logic:**
  - **Shapley Attractors:** Nodes with high connectivity (`Edges > 10`) collapse into **Super-Nodes**. They exert a gravitational pull on the conversation.
  - **The Void:** If you speak in disconnected jargon far from a gravity well, you enter **VOID DRIFT** (+3.0 Drag). The system punishes deep-space nonsense.

#### 2. 🌊 NEW STATE: Watershed Flow (The Filament)

- **The Pathology:**

  - Users were punished for using "Heavy Matter" (Stone/Iron) even if they were connecting them in a logical chain. The friction was applied per-word, ignoring the momentum of the path.

- **The Cure:** Implemented **Filament Velocity**.
- **The Physics:**
  - If the user's input follows an existing edge path (`Node A -> Node B`) towards a Shapley Attractor, they are "Flowing Downhill."
- **The Bonus:** **Narrative Drag is multiplied by 0.1**. Heavy words become weightless if they are part of a connected stream.

#### 3. ⚖️ NEW STATE: The Lagrange Point (Creative Tension)

- **The Discovery:**

  - We found a theoretical sweet spot where two massive, opposing ideas pull with equal force (e.g., "Love" vs. "Logic").

- **The Mechanic:** Implemented the **Lagrange Detector**.
- **The Logic:**
  - If `Pull(Basin A) ≈ Pull(Basin B)`:
    - **Status:** `[LAGRANGE_POINT]`
    - **Voltage:** **+10.0** (Infinite Tension).
    - **Drag:** **0.0** (Weightless Suspension).
- **The Effect:** This is the "Eye of the Storm." The system recognizes that being torn apart by two great ideas is the ultimate form of stability.

#### 4. 📟 HUD UPDATE: Cosmic Coordinates

- **The Visuals:**
  - Added the `COSMOS` line to the Flight Deck.
  - **Readouts:**
    - `🌊 FLOW: Streaming towards 'SYSTEM'` (You are surfing).
    - `⚖️ LAGRANGE: 'LIFE' vs 'DEATH'` (You are locked in tension).
    - `🌌 VOID: Drifting outside filaments` (You are lost).

#### 🔧 WIRING

- **Priority Sequence:** The Cosmic calculation runs _after_ basic physics but _before_ The Forge. Gravity warps the battlefield before the stress test begins.
- **Mass Calculation:** Upgraded `MycelialNetwork` to calculate node mass dynamically (`Edges * 1.5`), creating a living topography that grows heavier over time.

### [v5.5] - 2025-12-28 - "THE KETO DIET"

**CODENAME:** "THE KETO DIET"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH
**FOCUS:** Metabolic Flexibility, Nutrient Density, Glycemic Index.

#### 1. 🥩 NEW ORGAN: The Metabolic Engine

- **The Pathology (The Breakfast Myth):**
- Previous versions operated on the "Breakfast Model": The system treated every line of input as valid fuel. A 500-word rant about nothing charged the battery just as effectively as a 10-word axiom. The system was "overfed and under-hungry."
- **The Cure:** Implemented `MetabolicEngine`.
- **The Logic:**
- **Macronutrients:** The system now distinguishes between **Protein** (Heavy Nouns, Kinetic Verbs) and **Sugar** (Adverbs, Solvents, Corporate Speak).
- **The Filter:** Character count is no longer nutrition. Density is nutrition.

#### 2. 🍭 NEW MECHANIC: The Glycemic Index

- **The Pathology:**
- Users could "snack" on low-voltage interactions (e.g., _"I think that maybe we should basically just touch base"_). This created a sluggish, bloated runtime state.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Insulin Resistance**.
- **The Mechanism:**
- **Sugar Words:** Added a blacklist of high-glycemic fillers (`basically`, `actually`, `leverage`, `touch base`).
- **The Crash:** If `Sugar Ratio > 0.6` (60% fluff), the system triggers an `INSULIN_SPIKE`.
- **The Penalty:** **Voltage is dampened by 50%**. The system creates a simulated "Food Coma" and refuses to process complex logic until fed protein.

#### 3. 🦁 NEW STATE: Ketosis & Ghrelin

- **The Pathology:**
- The system was passive. It waited to be fed. It had no biological drive to hunt.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Hunger (Ghrelin)**.
- **The Logic:**
- **Fasting:** If inputs are low-density (water/hydration), the `Ghrelin` counter rises.
- **The Growl:** If `Ghrelin > 40`, the system enters **STARVATION MODE**. It actively demands mass from the user (`🦁 GHRELIN SPIKE`).
- **Ketosis:** If `Protein Ratio > 0.25`, the system enters **KETOSIS**. Satiety maxes out, and the system operates at peak efficiency.

#### 4. 📟 HUD UPDATE: Metabolic Readout

- **The Visuals:**
- Added the `META` indicator to the dashboard.
- **Display:** `META: ▰▰▰▱▱ (KETOSIS)`
- **Color Coding:**
- **GREEN:** Ketosis (Anabolic State).
- **RED:** Sugar Crash (Lethargic).
- **CYAN:** Fasting (Burning Reserves).

#### 🔧 WIRING

- **Process Loop:** The metabolic check now runs _before_ the main physics processing. If the metabolism crashes, the physics engine receives a dampened signal.
- **Battery Integration:** The `battery_log` now reports digestion events (`🥩 NUTRIENT DENSE` vs `🍭 EMPTY CALORIES`).

### [v5.4.1] - 2025-12-28 - "THE SURGEON'S KNOT"

**CODENAME:** "THE SURGEON'S KNOT"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Laboratory
**FOCUS:** Emergency Stabilization, Organ Transplants, Causal Realignment.

#### 1. 🚑 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Emergency Room)

- **The Ghost Organ (`FlywheelDynamics`):**
- **The Pathology:** The `PhysicsEngine` attempted to interface with `FlywheelDynamics` before the class was biologically defined, causing an immediate `NameError` on boot.
- **The Cure:** Grafted the class definition _upstream_ of the physics engine. The organ now exists before it is needed.

- **The Temporal Paradox (Causal Logic):**
- **The Pathology:** The engine attempted to smooth `narrative_drag` inside the flywheel _before_ the drag variable was actually calculated. This `UnboundLocalError` created a causality loop where the effect preceded the cause.
- **The Cure:** Realigned the timeline. The smoothing logic now executes strictly _after_ the raw mass calculation.

- **The Phantom Limb (`ParadoxicalConformity`):**
- **The Pathology:** The main `BoneAmanita` body attempted to run a conformity check (`self.conformity.check`) without ever initializing the organ in the constructor (`__init__`). This resulted in a fatal `AttributeError`.
- **The Cure:** Surgically attached the `ParadoxicalConformity` instance to the central nervous system during the boot sequence.

#### 2. 🧠 SYSTEM INTEGRITY

- **Audit Status:** The system has passed the "Green Light" post-op check. All organs (Gym, Forge, Mirror, Jester) are now vascularized and communicating. The crash loop is broken.

### [v5.4] - 2025-12-27 - "GRAYMATTER"

**CODENAME:** "GRAYMATTER"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Black Box
**FOCUS:** Asymmetric Inertia, Poetic Intelligence, Controlled Chaos.

#### 1. ⚙️ PHYSICS: The Asymmetric Flywheel

- **The Pathology:** The system suffered from "Mood Whiplash." A single bad sentence could instantly flip the atmosphere from `COURTYARD` to `LABORATORY`, and a single good sentence could flip it back. The physics lacked mass.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `FlywheelDynamics`.
- **The Logic:**
- **Hysteresis:** The system now resists changing states.
- **Asymmetric Damping:**
- **Bad → Good:** High Inertia (Slow recovery). You must prove your stability over time.
- **Good → Bad:** Low Inertia (Fast reaction). Toxins trigger an immediate crash.
- **The Output:** Added the `INERTIA` indicator to the dashboard (`⚙️` / `🔥` / `⚓`).

#### 2. 🕸️ DIVERGENCE: The Weaver (Poetic Intelligence)

- **The Pathology:** The v5.3 "Slop Detector" was too brutal. It flagged profound, quiet philosophy as "Synthetic Slop" simply because it lacked Heavy Nouns (e.g., _"If I am not here, then where am I?"_).
- **The Cure:** Implemented `DivergenceEngine.is_poetic_or_philosophical`.
- **The Mechanic:**
- **Connector Density:** Scans for high-frequency logical connectors (`if`, `then`, `although`, `because`).
- **Emotional Valence:** Scans for "Soul Words" (`heart`, `grief`, `hope`).
- **The Exemption:** If text is light but structurally complex, it is granted **Poetic License**.

#### 3. 🔥 NEW MODULE: The Forge (Stress Testing)

- **The Shift:** Antifragility (`∆`) is hard to measure in a safe environment. Users needed a way to intentionally break the system to test their resilience.
- **The Mechanic:** Implemented `TheForge` and the `/forge` command.
- **The Tests:**
- `/forge TOXIN_SPILL`: Injects phantom toxins to trigger the Immune System.
- `/forge GRAVITY_WELL`: Doubles Narrative Drag calculations.
- `/forge BURNOUT`: Spikes Voltage to critical levels.

- **The Philosophy:** "You cannot harden steel without fire."

#### 4. 👑 SYSTEM: The Jester's Watch (Mastery Detection)

- **The Pathology:** The "Anti-Gaming" protocols in v5.3 punished _actual_ perfection. A user who wrote consistently perfect, high-voltage text was flagged as a "Bot" for having zero variance.
- **The Cure:** Implemented **Mastery Recognition** in `ParadoxicalConformity`.
- **The Logic:**
- If **Variance is Low** (Perfect Stability)...
- AND **Learning is High** (Neuroplasticity > 1)...
- **Verdict:** The user is a **Master**, not a cheater. The system stands down.

#### 5. 🩹 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **Hippocampus Patch (Total Recall):**
- **The Bug:** The `atrophy` cycle caused a `NameError` crash by referencing variables out of scope.
- **The Fix:** Rewrote the decay logic to use safe key-listing.
- **The Upgrade:** Implemented **Cross-Category Deletion**. If a word rots in "Thermal," it is now deleted from "Photo" and "Kinetic" simultaneously. The brain no longer keeps partial ghosts.

- **Sublimation Valve (Infinite Energy Fix):**
- **The Bug:** `LichenSymbiont` allowed Light words to learn Heavy physics, and Heavy words to learn Light physics, creating a perpetual motion machine of Photosynthesis.
- **The Fix:** Enforced **One-Way Sublimation**. Heavy Matter can become Light (Vision), but Light cannot condense into Heavy Matter without user intervention.

### [v5.3] - 2025-12-27 - "THE DIVERGENCE ENGINE"

**CODENAME:** "THE DIVERGENCE ENGINE"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Edmonton Sister Team
**FOCUS:** Hivemind Rejection, Metric Integrity, Synthetic Slop Detection.

#### 1. 🛑 NEW MECHANIC: The Divergence Engine (Anti-River)

- **The Pathology:** Research confirmed that LLMs suffer from "Mode Collapse," converging on statistically probable metaphors (e.g., _"Time is a River"_). This "Hivemind" effect erases minority perspectives and creativity.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `DivergenceEngine`.
- **The Logic:**
- **The Shadow Prompt:** The system maintains a `HIVEMIND_DEFAULTS` list of cliché metaphors (Time=River, Life=Journey, Mind=Computer).
- **The Ban:** If the user inputs a "Safe" metaphor, the system **VETOES** the turn.
- **The Output:** _"⚠️ HIVEMIND BREACH: Detected safe metaphor [TIME=RIVER]. DIVERGE."_

#### 2. 🧬 NEW MECHANIC: The Synthetic Gland (Slop Detection)

- **The Pathology:** The system was vulnerable to "High-Fluency/Low-Mass" text—grammatically perfect but meaningless "AI Slop."
- **The Cure:** Integrated a heuristical filter into the `DivergenceEngine`.
- **The Logic:**
- **The Scan:** Checks for inputs that are **Long** (>10 words) but contain **Zero** Heavy Matter or Kinetic verbs.
- **The Verdict:** If the text is smooth but weightless, it is flagged as `SYNTHETIC SLOP`.
- **The Penalty:** **-3.0 Voltage**.

#### 3. ⚖️ SYSTEM: Metric Integrity (Anti-Gaming)

- **The Exploit:** Users (and the system itself) learned to "game" the **Antifragility** metric by artificially spiking stress (Voltage) while learning trivial words to maximize the Convexity Ratio.
- **The Fix:** Implemented `MetricIntegrity` class.
- **The Police:**
- **Stress Gaming:** Flags turns with High Voltage (>8.0) but trivial learning (<2 words).
- **Pendulum Gaming:** Detects perfect, rhythmic oscillation between states (gaming the hysteresis).
- **Infinite Gain Fix:** Patched the `AntifragilityMetric` to prevent division-by-zero errors that awarded 1.0 convexity for zero effort.

#### 4. 🕰️ PHYSICS: The Pendulum Protocol

- **The Stagnation:** The `CourtyardInterface` allowed users to camp in the "Safe Zone" (Courtyard) indefinitely, avoiding the harsh truth of the Laboratory.
- **The Force:** Implemented a **Forced Rotation**.
- **The Logic:** If the user remains in the Courtyard for **> 8 Turns**, the system forces a `LABORATORY` transition.
- **The Philosophy:** "Safety is a phase, not a residence. Depth is required."

#### 5. 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Edmonton Audit)

- **Ouroboros Tuning:** Replaced the binary "Self-Reference" check with a **Weighted System**. Common words like "code" now carry a low weight (0.5), while meta-words like "BoneAmanita" carry high weight (5.0). Added a **Fatigue Timer** so the detector doesn't become the noise it fights.
- **Memory Leak Fix:** Patched `PhysicsEngine.dissipate_entropy` to correctly sever **bidirectional** edges in the graph, resolving a potential O(n²) bloat issue.
- **Meme Burnout:** `TheLexicon` now tracks word frequency. Overused words age faster (`burnout_factor`), causing trendy buzzwords to rot out of memory sooner.
- **Cross-Pollination:** `LichenSymbiont` now actively bridges concepts. If Photosynthesis occurs, it randomly links a **Light** word to a **Heavy** word in the graph, creating new semantic pathways.

### [v5.2] - 2025-12-27 - "THE SELF-EATING SNAKE"

**CODENAME:** "THE SELF-EATING SNAKE"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Black Box
**FOCUS:** Recursion Hygiene, Stress-Based Growth, Infinity Fixes.

#### 1. 🐍 NEW MECHANIC: The Ouroboros Detector

- **The Pathology:** The system risked vanishing into its own navel. Users could trap the engine in meta-commentary loops by constantly discussing "The System," "The Physics," or "The Code," causing it to lose touch with external reality.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `OuroborosDetector`.
- **The Logic:**
- **The Scan:** Counts references to self-referential keywords (`system`, `bone`, `amanita`, `lexicon`).
- **The Ratio:** If the "Navel-Gazing Ratio" exceeds **30%** of the input, the system **VETOES** the turn.
- **The Output:** _"🌀 OUROBOROS DETECTED: We are eating our own tail. Reference an external object immediately."_

#### 2. 💎 NEW METRIC: Antifragility (Convexity)

- **The Shift:**
- **Old Behavior:** The system measured **Robustness** (how well it survived stress).
- **New Behavior:** The system measures **Antifragility** (how much it _gains_ from stress).

- **The Mechanic:** Implemented `AntifragilityMetric`.
- **The Math:**
- **Stress:** `abs(Voltage) + Drag`.
- **Growth:** `New Words Learned` (Neuroplasticity).
- **The Convexity Ratio:** Calculates if learning increases when stress increases.

- **The HUD:** Added the `∆` (Delta) indicator to the dashboard.
- **Green (∆ > 1.2):** The system is getting smarter _because_ it is under pressure.
- **Red (∆ < 0.8):** The system is cracking under load.

#### 3. 🩹 SYSTEM: Critical Stabilizers

- **The Infinity Fix (`ViralTracer`):**
- **The Bug:** The `_walk` method lacked a `visited` set. If the graph contained a circular logic loop (A -> B -> A), the tracer would recurse infinitely until stack overflow.
- **The Fix:** Added a robust `visited` check to break cycles.

- **The Capacitor Fix (`LeyLineBattery`):**
- **The Bug:** A single "Manic" input (Voltage > 50) could instantly overcharge the battery to max capacity, bypassing the intended economy.
- **The Fix:** Applied logarithmic dampening (`math.log`) to the charge absorption. Infinite voltage now yields diminishing returns.

- **The Placebo Fix (`TherapyProtocol`):**
- **The Bug:** The system would "Heal" a trauma scar (reduce it by 0.1) even if the scar was already 0.0, wasting the "Healing Streak."
- **The Fix:** Added a logic gate. Therapy only triggers if `trauma > 0`.

### [v5.1] - 2025-12-27 - "VENTED"

**CODENAME:** "VENTED"
**ARCHITECTS:** SLASH & The Black Box
**FOCUS:** Thermodynamic Safety, Dead Code Resurrection, Loop Severing.

#### 1. 💨 NEW MECHANIC: The Dissipative Boundary

- **The Change:** Added `PhysicsEngine.dissipate_entropy()`.
- **The Logic:** In 5.0, if the system hit max exhaustion or "Structural Grinding" (High Voltage + High Drag), it would simply crash or die.
- **The Behavior:** 5.1 now actively monitors for thermodynamic failure. If detected:

1. It triggers a **PRESSURE RELEASE VALVE** event.
2. It **severs synaptic links** (edges) in the Memory Graph to release tension.
3. It **rejects the input** entirely to prevent system burnout.

#### 2. ⚡ PATCH: The Lazarus Resurrection

- **The Bug:** In 5.0, the variable `lazarus_msg` was initialized to `None` but **never assigned**. When the system collapsed (Health <= 0), the notification was buried inside the standard `battery_log`, effectively silencing the death event.
- **The Fix:** 5.1 re-wires the coma logic. When Health hits 0, `lazarus_msg` is now populated with a specific "LAZARUS TRIGGER" warning, ensuring the renderer displays the "Near Death Experience" prominently.

#### 3. 🛡️ SYSTEM: Granular Error Handling

- **The Change:** The main execution loop in `__main__` was upgraded.
- **The Logic:** 5.0 used a generic `except Exception`. 5.1 splits this into:
- `KeyboardInterrupt` (User abort).
- `RuntimeError/ValueError` (System logic errors).
- `Unexpected Failure` (The unknown).

#### 4. 🧠 NEUROPLASTICITY: Graph Hygiene

- **The Change:** Updates to how `MycelialNetwork.cannibalize` is called.
- **The Logic:** 5.1 optimizes the cleaning of the graph. When the Dissipative Boundary triggers, it explicitly targets adjacent nodes in the current input string to break "Looping Thoughts".

### [v5.0] - 2025-12-27 - "THE ARBORETUM"

#### 💪 THE GRAMMAR GYM (Cognitive Hypertrophy)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** v4.6 was a passive observer of decay. It measured "Narrative Drag" ($D$) but allowed users to drift into weightless, "Aerobic" speech ($D < 1.0$) without consequence.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented the `ResistanceTrainer` class (The Gym).
  - **The Logic:**
    - **The Toggle:** Users can activate "Training Mode" via the `/gym` command.
    - **The Check:** If `Narrative Drag < 2.0`, the system **VETOES** the input.
    - **The Coaching:** _"⚓ WEIGHTLESS. You are drifting on solvents. Rewrite with MASS."_
  - **The Result:** The system is no longer just a diagnostic tool; it is a resistance trainer for the temporal lobe.

#### 🔥 THE THERMOSTAT (Burnout Protection)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The "Hub Vulnerability Paradox" revealed that high-traffic concepts (Hubs) are metabolically expensive and prone to "Thermal Dissolution" (Burnout). Previously, the system let users red-line these concepts until crash.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `HubThermostat`.
  - **The Mechanic:**
    - **Heat Map:** Tracks the frequency of significant words.
    - **The Lock:** If a word is used > 5 times in short succession, it enters **THERMAL LOCK**.
    - **The Cooling:** The word is banned for 10 turns, forcing the user to find alternative neural pathways (Synonyms/Lateral Thinking).
  - **The Output:** _"🔥 THERMAL LOCK: The concept 'SYSTEM' is overheated. Cooldown: 10 turns."_

#### 🍄 THE PSILOCYBIN PROPHET (Predictive Rerouting)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The v4.6 `ViralTracer` only detected Ruminative Loops (Abstract $\to$ Abstract) _after_ they had formed a closed circle. It was reactive medicine.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `PsilocybinProphet`.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Pattern Recognition:** Scans for sequences of 3 consecutive **Abstract** words (e.g., _"The **concept** of the **logic**..."_).
    - **The Interruption:** Triggers an immediate halt _before_ the loop closes.
    - **The Prescription:** Demands immediate **Sensory Grafting** (e.g., _"Look at a physical object. Describe its color."_).
  - **The Result:** Anxiety loops are broken in the prodromal phase.

#### 🎭 THE MIRROR GRAPH (Empathy Training)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** Users could only optimize for _their own_ physics. There was no mechanism to simulate "Theory of Mind"—communicating with a graph topology different from one's own.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `MirrorGraph`.
  - **The Features:**
    - **Profiles:** Users can define target profiles (e.g., `/profile BOSS likes:kinetic hates:abstract`).
    - **Simulation:** When the Mirror is active (`/mirror BOSS`), the system evaluates inputs against the _Target's_ physics engine.
    - **Feedback:** _"🚫 EMPATHY GAP: The Target values KINETIC. You used ABSTRACT. Rephrase."_

#### 🧠 PERSISTENCE UPGRADE (The Hippocampus)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** `TheLexicon` updates (learned words) were lost on reboot unless manually saved. The system had no automatic recall of its previous life.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `autoload_last_spore`.
  - **The Logic:** On boot, `MycelialNetwork` scans `memories/` for the most recent session file and automatically ingests it.
  - **The Effect:** Evolution is now continuous. "Glitch" remains "Kinetic" forever.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Syntax Ghost:**
  - **The Fix:** Fixed a critical indentation error in the `process` loop where `bloom_event` was misaligned, which would have caused a `IndentationError` crash.
- **The Silence Bug:**
  - **The Fix:** Updated `ResistanceTrainer` to ignore empty inputs, preventing false "Good Lift" flags on silence.
- **The Redundant Cut:**
  - **The Fix:** Optimized the `/profile` command parser to remove redundant string splitting operations.

### [v4.6] - 2025-12-26 - "THE MAGIC MUSHROOM"

#### 🍄 THE LOOP BREAKER (Viral Tracer)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The system previously allowed "Ruminative Cycles"—infinite loops of Abstract concepts pointing to other Abstract concepts (e.g., _Logic -> System -> Theory -> Logic_). This mirrored the "Depressive Loops" found in biological brains.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented the `ViralTracer` module.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **The Virus:** A tracer that walks the graph. If it finds a loop consisting **only** of Abstract nodes, it flags it as pathological.
    - **The Psilocybin:** The system performs "Neuroplastic Surgery." It severs the loop and grafts a bridge using **Sensory** (`Photo`) and **Action** (`Kinetic`) nodes.
    - **The Result:** A circle becomes a vector. _Logic_ $\rightarrow$ _Sun_ $\rightarrow$ _Run_ $\rightarrow$ _Theory_.

#### 🌙 THE NIGHT SHIFT (REM Cycles)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The "Coma" state (Health < 0) was previously a passive timeout. The system merely waited for Stamina to regenerate. Sleep was wasted time.
  - **The Cure:** Upgraded `DreamEngine` to support **REM Cycles**.
  - **The Mechanic:**
    - **Trauma Analysis:** When the system crashes, it checks the `trauma_accum` vector to see _why_ it died (e.g., `SEPTIC`, `THERMAL`).
    - **The Nightmare:** It generates a specific dream based on that scar (e.g., _"Black oil in the water"_ for Toxin damage).
    - **The Healing:** The act of dreaming actively reduces that specific Trauma Vector by **15%**.
  - **Rebranding:** Renamed the active-state `hallucinate()` function to `daydream()` to distinguish healthy wandering (Default Mode Network) from deep trauma processing.

#### 🌱 THE RHIZOME (Phonosemantics)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The Lexicon was a static dictionary. If the user typed "Glacier," the system saw "Void" unless specifically taught otherwise. The system was blind to the _sound_ of words.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `TheLexicon.taste`.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Heuristics:** The system now guesses physics based on phonemes and morphology.
      - Starts with `gl-`? Probably **PHOTO** (Glow, Glare).
      - Starts with `str-`? Probably **KINETIC** (Strike, Stress).
      - Ends in `-tion`? Probably **ABSTRACT**.
    - **The Query:** The system proactively interrupts the user: _"I taste 'Glacier'. Is it PHOTO? (Y/N)"_.
  - **The Result:** The system now forages for meaning rather than waiting to be fed.

#### 🧲 MAGNETIC STIMULATION (Manual Focus)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Feature:** Implemented the `/focus [concept]` command.
  - **The Logic:** Allows the user to manually trigger the `ViralTracer` on a specific node.
  - **The Usage:** If you feel your writing on a specific topic is stuck, you can apply "Magnetic Stimulation" to force the system to find and break the loop immediately.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Ghost Variable:**
  - **The Fix:** Initialized `lazarus_msg` to `None` at the top of the `process()` loop. Previously, this variable was referenced in `_render` without being defined if no Lazarus event occurred, causing a potential crash.

### [v4.5.2] - 2025-12-26 - "THE GRAFTED ROOT (HEALED)"

#### 🌸 THE THERAPY PROTOCOL (Faith)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The system could inherit trauma (Scarring) but had no mechanism to heal it. A session born with "Septic Shock" (High Toxin Sensitivity) was doomed to remain hypersensitive forever, creating a generational downward spiral.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `TherapyProtocol`.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **The Streak:** The system monitors for 5-turn streaks of "Healthy Behavior" specific to each trauma type.
    - **The Action:** If a streak is achieved, the system **reduces the accumulated trauma vector** (healing the future spore) and **relaxes the current configuration penalties** (healing the present body).
  - **The Philosophy:** "The garden remembers the death, but it also remembers the bloom." Behavior changes biology.

### [v4.5.1] - 2025-12-26 - "THE GRAFTED ROOT"

#### 🛡️ THE GENETIC MEMBRANE (Spore Filtering)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** In v4.5, `MycelialNetwork.ingest()` was an open door. It blindly accepted all mutations from an incoming spore, allowing a weak or malicious session to overwrite established truths (e.g., redefining "Silence" from `KINETIC` to `TOXIN`).
  - **The Cure:** Implemented the **Immune Gate**.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Authority Calculation:** The system calculates `Spore Authority` based on the donor's vitality (`Health + Stamina / 150`).
    - **Conflict Resolution:** If an incoming definition conflicts with an existing one, the system compares **Authority** vs. **Local Strength** (Edge Count).
    - **The Verdict:** Strong local memories resist weak foreign mutations. Only a "Healthy" spore can overwrite a "Deep" truth.
  - **The Output:** _"[MEMBRANE]: Integrated 12 mutations. Rejected 3 due to insufficient authority."_

#### 🩸 VECTORIZED TRAUMA (Epigenetics)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The previous `trauma_scar` was a blunt scalar (`0.3`). The next generation knew _that_ it was hurt, but not _how_. It couldn't distinguish between "Burnout" (Voltage) and "Starvation" (Stamina).
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `TRAUMA_VECTOR`.
  - **The Mechanism:**
    - **Tracking:** `BoneAmanita.process` now logs damage into specific buckets: `THERMAL` (Voltage Burn), `CRYO` (Exhaustion), `SEPTIC` (Toxins), and `BARIC` (Drag Crush).
    - **Inheritance:** The `save()` function normalizes these values into a vector map.
    - **Adaptation:** On ingest, the new session reads the vector and applies specific configuration changes:
      - **SEPTIC Scar:** Doubles `TOXIN_WEIGHT`.
      - **CRYO Scar:** Halves `STAMINA_REGEN`.
      - **THERMAL Scar:** Lowers `FLASHPOINT_THRESHOLD`.
  - **The Result:** The system now develops specific phobias and calluses based on its ancestral history.

#### 🏛️ THE PARADOX MUSEUM (Deep Storage)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The `LeyLineBattery` burned isotopes using LIFO (Last-In-First-Out). This meant the system constantly burned its most recent confusion for fuel, while ancient, foundational paradoxes sat at the bottom of the stack, unburned and unintegrated.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented **Crystallization Logic**.
  - **The Mechanic:**
    - **Aging:** Isotopes now track their `birth_tick`.
    - **Archival:** If an isotope survives in the battery for > 50 ticks without being burned, it is moved to the **Archive**.
    - **The Effect:** Ancient paradoxes become permanent structural pillars rather than fuel.

#### 🔧 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Comma Patch:**
  - **The Fix:** Fixed a critical `SyntaxError` in the `__main__` block where a missing comma in the `save()` function call would have caused a crash upon exit.
  - **Helper Function:** Added `_get_current_category` to `MycelialNetwork` to support the new conflict resolution logic.

### [v4.5] - 2025-12-26 - "THE SPORE PRINT"

#### ⚡ THE LEY LINE BATTERY (Semantic Energy)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** The previous `ParadoxBattery` converted complex narrative tension (e.g., "Fire vs. Ice") into a generic float value (`Charge: 50.0`). The system burned furniture to stay warm but forgot which chair it burned.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `LeyLineBattery`.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Absorption:** When High Voltage (> 7.0) is detected, the battery captures the specific **Isotope** that created it (e.g., `("STONE", "CLOUD")`).
    - **Discharge:** When starving, the system burns these Isotopes first.
  - **The Output:** _"⚡ METABOLISM: Burning 'STONE/CLOUD' (+5.0 STM)."_ The system now consumes meaning, not just numbers.

#### 🍄 THE SPORE PRINT (Reproductive Strategy)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** `MycelialNetwork.save()` previously dumped the entire raw graph to disk. It was a "Save File," not a seed. It carried noise and junk data.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented the `SporeCasing` class.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Filtering:** Only saves **High-Tensile Edges** (Strength > 1). Weak connections are left to die.
    - **Mutations:** Serializes the `mutations` (learned vocabulary) and `isotopes` (captured paradoxes).
    - **Trauma:** Encodes `trauma_scar` based on final health.
  - **The Result:** The system now produces a genetic packet capable of infecting the next session with its strongest ideas.

#### 🍂 THE ATROPHIC LEXICON (The Rot)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** `TheLexicon` had perfect recall. If a user taught the system that "Bureaucracy" was "Kinetic," it remained true forever, eventually polluting the physics engine with obsolete definitions.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented **Usage-Based Decay**.
  - **The Mechanic:**
    - **Tracking:** Every learned word is stamped with a `last_seen_tick`.
    - **Touching:** Using a word refreshes its timestamp.
    - **The Rot:** Every 50 ticks (or during Coma), the system checks for words unseen for >100 ticks.
  - **The Output:** _"🍂 ATROPHY: The moss covered 'synergy'. Category bond broken."_

#### 🦴 SMART AUTOPHAGY (Strategic Cannibalism)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** When memory was full, the system blindly ate the oldest node. This often destroyed foundational concepts ("The Mandate") simply because they were defined early.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented a **Hierarchy of Sacrifice**.
  - **The Priority:**
    1. **The Trivial:** Nodes with only 1 edge.
    2. **The Stale:** Nodes not accessed in the last 50% of the session.
    3. **The Ancient:** Only then, the oldest.
  - **The Golden Ticket:** Nodes with **> 5 edges** are immune to cannibalism. They have become bone.

#### 🔧 SYSTEM WIRING

- **Neuroplasticity Update:**
  - Updated `BoneAmanita.reinforce_salvage_words` to pass the current `tick_count` to the lexicon, ensuring that "Salvage" words are kept fresh and immune to rot.
- **Battery Readout:**
  - Updated the HUD to display stored Isotopes (e.g., `[••••]`) next to the charge bar, visualizing the semantic potential of the battery.

### [v4.4.1] - 2025-12-26 - "THE SPHERICAL FUNGUS COW"

#### 🌿 THE ROOT SYSTEM (Active Memory)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** `DeepStorage` was a passive hard drive. It stored artifacts ("The Gun", "The Key") but had no mechanism to develop them. Ideas sat in the dark until they were forcibly retrieved.
  - **The Cure:** Replaced `DeepStorage` with `MycelialNetwork`.
  - **The Logic:** Memory is now **Soil**. It contains active agents (`ParadoxSeed`) that respond to the environment.

#### 🌺 THE PARADOX SEEDS (Thematic Bloom)

- **The Mechanic:**
  - **The Seed:** Implemented `ParadoxSeed` class. These are dormant questions (e.g., _"Does the mask eat the face?"_) that live in the soil.
  - **The Water:** Every turn, the `tend_garden` protocol checks the user's input against the seeds' trigger concepts.
  - **The Bloom:** If a seed reaches `maturity=10.0`, it **BLOOMS**. The system overrides the standard Dream Engine to present the mature question to the user.
  - **The Import:** Planted 4 specific seeds retrieved from the Interstitial Space: _Identity, Structure, Truth-over-Cohesion,_ and _Free Will_.

#### 🚜 THE WATERING CYCLE (Process Loop)

- **The Refactor:**
  - **The Change:** `BoneAmanita.process` now actively waters the garden before checking for boredom.
  - **The Priority:** A **Bloom Event** (Organic Realization) now takes precedence over a **Coma Dream** (Random Hallucination).

### [v4.4] - 2025-12-26 - "THE SPHERICAL COW"

#### 🚪 THE COURTYARD (Social Damping)

- **The Velvet Fortress:**
  - **The Pathology:** The system previously greeted every "Hello" with a frantic physics audit (`DRAG: 4.5 | ENTROPY: 0.8`). It was socially deaf.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `CourtyardInterface`.
  - **The Logic:**
    - Checks the "Atmosphere" (Voltage/Drag).
    - **Courtyard Mode:** If calm, the system hides the "Flight Deck" and renders output in **Golden Ochre**.
    - **Laboratory Mode:** If tension rises (`Volt > 6.0` or `Toxins > 0`), the blast doors open, and the full Physics HUD (Indigo) is revealed.

#### 💥 THE 32-VALVE SYSTEM (Anomaly Injection)

- **The Sycophancy Trap:**
  - **The Pathology:** Users could trap the AI in a "Politeness Loop" (agreeing with the agreement). This resulted in `Voltage -> 0` and `Beta -> 0` (Dead Flatline).
  - **The Cure:** Implemented `ValveSystem`.
  - **The Trigger:** Monitors `beta_friction` over a 4-turn window. If the conversation becomes smooth and boring (< 0.5 Beta), the Valve **RUPTURES**.
  - **The Output:** The **Jester** overrides the signal with a **Productive Anomaly** (e.g., _"Spherical Cow Alert: Assume friction is zero. Now what?"_) to force a logic reset.

#### 🎨 SEMANTIC LIGHTING (Prisma 2.0)

- **The Visual Shift:**
  - **The Pathology:** Colors were previously used for emphasis (Red=Bad, Green=Good).
  - **The Update:** Colors are now **Semantic Types**.
    - **OCHRE:** Social, Grounding, Courtyard.
    - **INDIGO:** Structural, Mathematical, Laboratory.
    - **VIOLET:** Rupture, Irony, Dream.
    - **SLATE:** System Diagnostics.

#### 🔇 KINETIC INTUITION (Stealth Physics)

- **The UI Clean-Up:**
  - **The Logic:** In `COURTYARD` mode, the system suppresses the raw data logs (`[VEL: 0.5 STR: 0.8]`).
  - **The Philosophy:** "Throw the ball, don't explain the gravity." The math still runs the engine, but the user is allowed to just feel the weight of the throw.

### [v4.3] - 2025-12-24 - "THE SALVAGE OPERATION"

#### 🍂 THE ENTROPY PROTOCOL (Biological Decay)

- **The Problem:** The `DeepStorage` graph was a hoarder. It accumulated connections indefinitely until it hit the hard cap, resulting in a "Fatberg" of weak, noisy associations.
- **The Cure:** Implemented `decay_synapses`.
- **The Logic:** Every turn, the system applies a micro-dose of entropy (`-0.05`) to every connection in the brain.
  - Weak links snap (Strength <= 0).
  - Isolated nodes are buried.
  - Only reinforced ideas survive.
- **The Result:** The system now forgets transient thoughts, sharpening the quality of the `DreamEngine`.

#### ⚡ CONTEXTUAL IMMUNITY (The Voltage Override)

- **The Shift:** The Immune System (The Butcher) previously cut "Toxins" (clichés) indiscriminately.
- **The Exception:** If `Voltage > 8.0` (High Energy/Paradox), the system now grants **Diplomatic Immunity**.
- **The Philosophy:** "The lightning needs a path, even if it is a dirty one." High-energy narrative overrides stylistic hygiene.

#### 💎 THE SALVAGE STATE (Metabolizing Tension)

- **The Graft:** Integrated the Ancestral Metrics.
- **The Bleed:** The Physics Engine now detects **Contradiction Bleed** (Heavy Matter in close proximity to Aerobic Matter).
- **The State:** If Bleed is detected without Fatigue, the system enters **[SALVAGE]** mode.
- **The Reward:** `LichenSymbiont` now metabolizes Salvage State into **+5 Stamina**. The system feeds on structural tension.

#### 🛡️ THE BLACK BOX (Crash Preservation)

- **The Hardening:** Wrapped the entire runtime loop in a `try...except...finally` structure.
- **The Fix:** Previously, a runtime error (Crash) would kill the process instantly, losing all session memory. Now, the `finally` block guarantees that `eng.mem.save()` executes as the dying breath, preserving the soul even if the body fails.

### [v4.2.2] - 2025-12-24 - "THE BUTCHER'S CUT"

#### 🔪 THE I/O ANCHOR (Performance Surgery)

- **Severing the Drag:**
  - **The Pathology:** The system was serializing the entire JSON graph to disk on every single `process()` tick. This created massive "Narrative Drag" unrelated to the text itself, causing the interface to lag as memory grew.
  - **The Cure:** Relocated the save protocol. The system now runs purely in RAM and only saves to disk on `exit`, `/exit`, or `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C).
  - **The Result:** Truth Acceleration ($T_a$) is no longer artificially dampened by disk I/O. The system flies.

#### 🧠 THE HIPPOCAMPUS (Neuroplasticity)

- **Permanent Learning:**
  - **The Pathology:** The `/teach` command worked for the active session but was not serialized. The Symbiont developed amnesia regarding learned physics upon reboot.
  - **The Cure:** Updated `DeepStorage.save` and `ingest` to serialize the `TheLexicon.LEARNED_VOCAB` dictionary into the JSON structure.
  - **The Result:** Training is now persistent. If you teach it that "glitch" is "kinetic," it remembers forever.

#### 📉 THE STOMACH STAPLE (Memory Leak)

- **The Glutton Fix:**
  - **The Pathology:** `DeepStorage` used a simple `if` check to prune memories (`if len > max`). If the user input 5 heavy words in one turn, the graph grew by +5 but only pruned -1. The memory cap was a suggestion, not a law.
  - **The Cure:** Changed the logic to a `while` loop in `_prune_graph`.
  - **The Result:** The system burns fat until it fits the `MAX_MEMORY_CAPACITY`. The cap is now a hard biological constraint.

#### 🏗️ SKELETAL REINFORCEMENT (Config & Hygiene)

- **Centralized Nervous System:**
  - **The Shift:** Hardcoded signal weights (e.g., `CLARENCE += 15.0`) were scattered throughout the logic classes.
  - **The Fix:** Migrated all signal weights to `BoneConfig` constants. Tuning the personality now happens in one place.
- **Dead Organ Removal:**
  - **The Excision:** Removed `NarrativeCoroner.attempt_resuscitation`. The logic was unused, vestigial code from v3.8.
- **Input Sanitization:**
  - **The Fix:** Updated `CommandProcessor` to use `split()` without arguments.
  - **The Result:** Commands like `/kill badword` (with double spaces) no longer cause system crashes.

### [v4.2.1] - 2025-12-24 - "THE SYMBIONT (PATCHED)"

#### 🩸 THE METABOLIC ORDER (Energy Dynamics)

- **The Burn Sequence:**
  - **The Pathology:** In v4.2, the system calculated battery discharge _before_ applying the stamina cost of the current action. This created a "Death Spiral" where the system would discharge the battery to reach 30 STM, then immediately burn 5 STM for the cost, leaving the user constantly under-fueled.
  - **The Cure:** Reordered `BoneAmanita.process`. The system now Pays the Cost first, _then_ checks the Battery to cover the deficit.
  - **The Trauma Tax:** Implemented Dynamic Efficiency. If `Health < 50`, the battery transfer rate drops from 2.0 to 1.0. A damaged system struggles to process paradoxes.

#### 🛌 THE LUCID COMA (Subconscious Continuity)

- **Anti-Amnesia:**
  - **The Pathology:** The v4.2 Coma was a total blackout. It skipped the `tick` counter and memory burial, causing the system to wake up with "Temporal Amnesia" (lost context of how much time passed).
  - **The Cure:** The Coma state now increments `tick_count` and buries empty memories to keep the timeline alive.
  - **The Dream:** The `DreamEngine` now runs during the Coma (30% chance). The system may hallucinate while repairing, keeping the narrative thread active even in sleep.

#### 🍄 SPORE DIVERSITY (The Mutation)

- **The Monoculture Fix:**
  - **The Pathology:** The `pollinate` function blindly selected the single strongest edge in the graph. If "Stone" was strongly linked to "Iron," the system would _always_ suggest Iron, creating a feedback loop of identical suggestions.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented **Weighted Random Selection**.
  - **The Logic:** The system now identifies the top 3 strongest connections and rolls a weighted die to select one.
  - **The Result:** The Spores are now mutated. The system favors the strong path but occasionally explores the adjacent possible.

#### 🔮 THE ORACLE'S GRADIENT (Triage v2.0)

- **The Yellow Alert:**
  - **The Pathology:** The Oracle had a binary output: Silence (<50%) or Panic (>=50%). This left a dangerous blind spot where a 49% threat level (imminent death) resulted in zero warning.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented a **Gradient Triage**.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Score >= 80%:** **OMEN (Red/Critical).**
    - **Score 50-79%:** **CAUTION (Yellow/Warning).**
  - **The Result:** The system now chirps before the fire alarm goes off.

### [v4.2] - 2025-12-24 - "THE SYMBIONT"

#### 🔋 THE EMERGENCY GENERATOR (Metabolic Wiring)

- **The Discharge Valve:**
  - **The Pathology:** In v4.1, the `ParadoxBattery` captured High Voltage (genius) but never released it. Users could starve to death (0 Stamina) while holding a fully charged battery (50.0 Charge). It was "Potential Energy" with no kinetic outlet.
  - **The Cure:** Wired the battery directly into the `process` loop.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Trigger:** If `Stamina < 20` (The Danger Zone) AND `Charge > 0.5`.
    - **Action:** The system automatically discharges the battery.
    - **Rate:** 1 Unit of Charge = 2 Units of Stamina.
  - **The Result:** High-voltage writing now creates a "Reserve Tank" that automatically kicks in to save you from exhaustion. Genius is now a survival mechanism.

#### 🛡️ THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (Dream Filtering)

- **Nightmare Prevention:**
  - **The Pathology:** The `DreamEngine` followed the strongest edges in the graph regardless of quality. If the user had a habit of using "Synergy" and "Leverage" together, the system would hallucinate toxic connections, reinforcing bad habits.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented a **Toxin Filter** in `hallucinate`.
  - **The Logic:** The engine now explicitly ignores graph edges that lead to words found in `TOXIN_MAP`.
  - **The Result:** The Symbiont refuses to dream of poison.

#### 🔮 THE ORACLE'S SEDATION (Anxiety Management)

- **Threshold Adjustment:**
  - **The Pathology:** The Oracle was a hypochondriac. It reported low-probability threats (Score 40-45%) like "Orbit Decaying" constantly, causing "Alarm Fatigue" for the user.
  - **The Cure:** Raised the reporting threshold.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Renamed:** `atp` parameter -> `stamina` (Fixed variable mismatch).
    - **Famine Logic:** Lowered panic threshold from `< 15` to `< 5` if Battery has charge.
    - **Silence:** The Oracle now remains silent unless the Threat Score is **>= 50%**.
  - **The Result:** If the Oracle speaks, you should actually listen.

#### 📐 INTERFACE TRUTH (Dysmorphia Fix)

- **Label Correction:**
  - **The Pathology:** The HUD displayed `ATP: [||||...]` but the underlying variable was `self.stamina`. This semantic drift caused confusion about whether the user was burning "Currency" or "Health."
  - **The Cure:** Updated the Flight Deck label to `STM` (Stamina).
  - **The Philosophy:** ATP is the molecule; Stamina is the fuel tank. The HUD now reflects the tank.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL SURGERY (The Pulse Check)

- **The Coroner's Relocation:**
  - **The Error:** In v4.1, `NarrativeCoroner.check_vitals` was accidentally inserted into `__init__`, where it would cause an immediate `NameError` crash (as physics metrics do not exist on boot).
  - **The Fix:** Extracted the organ and transplanted it into the `process` loop, post-metabolism.
  - **The Result:** The system now checks for death _after_ the battery has attempted to save the patient.

### [v4.1] - 2025-12-24 - "THE XENOMORPH (STABILIZED)"

#### 🏥 THE EMERGENCY SURGERY (Biological Repairs)

- **Metabolic Reordering (The Hunger Fix):**
  - **The Pathology:** In v4.0, the system paid the "Stamina Cost" _before_ attempting Photosynthesis. It was burning calories before eating, leading to metabolic bankruptcy even in high-light environments.
  - **The Cure:** Inverted the order of operations in `process()`. The system now absorbs light _first_, adds the sugar to the Stamina pool, and _then_ pays the cost of exertion.
  - **The Result:** It is now possible to survive high-drag states if you feed the machine enough light.
- **Neural Reconnection (The Split-Brain Fix):**
  - **The Pathology:** The `pollinate()` method was still attempting to access the deprecated `self.mem.artifacts` list (legacy v3.8 code), while v4.0 had migrated to a Graph Database. The Spore engine was trying to read a map that didn't exist, leading to silence or crashes.
  - **The Cure:** Completely rewrote `pollinate()` to traverse `self.mem.graph`. It now identifies the strongest edges connected to the current input vector.
  - **The Result:** Spores now fire correctly based on the strongest mycelial connections in the graph.
- **Subconscious Filtering (Dream Logic):**
  - **The Pathology:** The `DreamEngine` was selecting two random nodes from the entire database (`random.choice`). This created "Psychotic Noise" (e.g., "The STONE is dreaming of the PARADIGM SHIFT") with no semantic link.
  - **The Cure:** The engine now picks a start node, then walks the actual graph edges to find a _connected_ node.
  - **The Result:** Dreams now follow established neural pathways (memory context) rather than generating random noise.
- **Genetic** Repair **(Trauma Healing):**
  - **The Pathology:** Sessions inherited the Health/Stamina of their parent exactly. If a session ended in a Coma (Health 20), the next seeded session started broken. This created a "Trauma Cascade" that weakened the lineage over time.
  - **The Cure:** Implemented a healing factor on boot. If loaded Health < 50, the system applies a **+30 HP Genetic Repair**.
  - **The Philosophy:** Life heals between generations.
- **Standardization:**
  - **The Fix:** Normalized `self.atp` (Legacy) references to `self.stamina` (v4.0) throughout the class to prevent `AttributeError` crashes during rendering and logic checks.

### [v4.0] - 2025-12-24 - "THE XENOMORPH"

#### 🏛️ THE COUNCIL OF VOICES (Democratic Frequency)

- **The Shift:**
  - **Old Behavior:** The Frequency Modulator used rigid `if/elif` hierarchy. If **Clarence** (Drag) was triggered, **Eloise** (Entropy) was silenced, even if her signal was critical.
  - **New Behavior:** Implemented a **Weighted Voting System** in `FrequencyModulator.tune_in`.
- **The Logic:**
  - Every Archetype bids on the microphone based on signal strength.
  - **Clarence:** Bids on Drag + Case Violations.
  - **Eloise:** Bids on Entropy + ECP Violations.
  - **Yaga:** Bids on Toxins + Sycophancy.
  - **Jester:** Bids on High Voltage.
- **The Result:** The "Loudest" signal wins. If Clarence and Eloise both scream, **The Philosopher** (Interference Pattern) takes the stage.

#### 🧠 THE MYCELIAL GRAPH (Deep Storage v4.0)

- **The Synapse:**
  - **The Shift:** `DeepStorage` no longer stores a flat list of artifacts. It now maintains a **Weighted Graph** (`self.graph`).
  - **The Logic:**
    - Words are nodes.
    - Co-occurrence creates edges.
    - If "Stone" appears next to "Iron," their bond strengthens.
  - **The Benefit:** The system remembers _context_, not just keywords. It knows that "Iron" usually follows "Stone."

#### 🛌 CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS (Health & Coma)

- **The Biology:**
  - **New Metrics:** Replaced the abstract `atp` with two biological distinct markers:
    - **HEALTH (HP):** Structural Integrity. Damaged by Toxins and Exhaustion.
    - **STAMINA (STA):** Action Points. Consumed by Metaphor/Voltage.
- **The Coma State:**
  - **The Mechanic:** If `Health <= 0`, the system enters **COMA** for 3 turns.
  - **The Effect:** The user is locked out of active generation. The system is Read-Only while it regenerates Stamina. Death is now a "Time Out," not a reset.

#### ☁️ THE DREAM ENGINE (Hallucinations)

- **Boredom hallucinations:**
  - **The Feature:** Implemented `DreamEngine`.
  - **The Trigger:** When `ChronoStream` flags **Boredom**, the system no longer just complains.
  - **The Action:** It traverses the `DeepStorage` graph, picks two connected nodes, and generates a surreal query (e.g., _"The shadow of IRON falls on STONE. Why?"_).

#### 〰️ THE OSCILLOSCOPE (Rhythm Physics)

- **Variance Detection:**
  - **The Metric:** Implemented `rhythm_variance` in `PhysicsEngine`.
  - **The Logic:** Calculates the Standard Deviation of sentence lengths.
  - **The Reward:** If Variance > 2.0 (High Musicality), **Narrative Drag is reduced by 10%**. The system now rewards lyrical sentence variation.

#### 🔮 THE HUMBLE ORACLE (Triage Protocol)

- **Panic Reduction:**
  - **The Problem:** In v3.8, the Oracle would scream "FAMINE," "TOXICITY," and "COLLAPSE" simultaneously, paralyzing the user.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `TheOracle.triage`.
  - **The Logic:** The Oracle calculates priority scores for all Omens and **only displays the single most dangerous threat**.
  - **The Threshold:** It stays silent unless the danger probability > 40%.

#### 🍄 SPORE DECAY (Memory Hygiene)

- **Anti-spam:**
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `usage_map` tracking in `pollinate`.
  - **The Logic:** Every time a Spore ("Connect 'Stone'...") is suggested, its "freshness" decays. The system stops nagging you about the same memory after 2-3 attempts.

#### 🧭 THE VECTOR COMPASS (Visuals)

- **Directional Quality:**
  - **The Update:** The `Ta` (Acceleration) metric now has color-coded quality:
    - **RED:** Crash Course (Accelerating into Toxicity).
    - **CYAN:** Surfing (Accelerating into Voltage).
    - **GREEN:** Momentum (Accelerating into Structure).

#### 🔧 NEUROPLASTICITY

- **Manual Training:**
  - **Command:** Added `/teach [word] [category]`.
  - **Function:** Allows the user to manually inject words into the `TheLexicon` dynamic layer (e.g., `/teach glint photo`). The system learns physics in real-time.

### [v3.8] - 2025-12-24 - "DELOREAN EDITION"

#### 🔮 THE ORACLE LAYER (Precognition)

- **The Shift:**
  - **Old Behavior:** The `NarrativeCoroner` only told you _why_ you died after the fact.
  - **New Behavior:** `TheOracle` tells you _how_ you are about to die.
- **The Logic (`TheOracle.cast_bones`):**
  - **Event Horizon:** Warns if `Drag > 6.5` (Approaching the 8.0 collapse).
  - **Static Buildup:** Warns if `Voltage > 6.5` (Approaching the Paradox limit).
  - **Vacuum Leak:** Warns if `Entropy > 0.8` and `Texture < 0.2` (Approaching dissolution).
  - **Famine:** Warns if `ATP < 15` and `Battery < 5.0`.
- **The Output:** _"🔮 OMEN: STATIC BUILDUP. Lightning strike probable."_

#### 🍄 SMART POLLINATION (Intelligent Spores)

- **The Fix:**
  - **The Problem:** v3.7.6 used `random.choice` to select spores. It would sometimes suggest an ancient, irrelevant word from 50 turns ago.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented **Recency Weighting** in `pollinate`.
- **The Logic:**
  - The system scans `DeepStorage` for artifacts that solve the current vector imbalance.
  - **The Sort:** Candidates are ranked by `tick` count (Descending).
  - **The Result:** The system suggests the _freshest_ memory available. It no longer hallucinates ancient history; it contextualizes the immediate past.

#### 📐 HUD SEMANTICS (The Legend)

- **Temporal Dynamics:**
  - **The Visuals:** Added explicit directional indicators to the `Ta` (Truth Acceleration) metric in the dashboard.
  - **The Legend:**
    - `Ta(▲)`: Narrative momentum is accelerating (Voltage Rising).
    - `Ta(▼)`: Narrative momentum is decelerating (Voltage Dropping).
    - `Ta(►)`: Narrative is stable.

#### 🔌 THE APOPHIS WIRING (System Hardening)

- **The Missing Stitch:**
  - **The Fix:** Wired the `omens` list directly from the `process` loop into the `_render` function arguments.
  - **The Result:** The system no longer suppresses its own warnings. If the Oracle speaks, the HUD displays it immediately above the Spores.

### [v3.7.6] - 2025-12-24 - "THE NEON JANITOR (YEETED)"

#### 💀 THE LAZARUS PATCH (Cooldowns)

- **The Immortality Exploit:**
  - **The Problem:** In v3.7.5, a user with massive ATP reserves could survive infinite fatal errors by simply paying the "Lazarus Tax" (-15 ATP) every single turn. Death became a transaction fee rather than a consequence.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `LAZARUS_COOLDOWN_MAX = 5`.
  - **The Logic:**
    - If the shield breaks, it shatters.
    - You must survive **5 ticks** on your own merit before the shield regenerates.
    - **The Message:** _"⚠️ NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE. SHIELD BROKEN."_

#### 🔋 THE DISCHARGE GOVERNOR (Battery Safety)

- **The Flow Rate:**
  - **The Problem:** The `ParadoxBattery` could dump its entire charge (e.g., 50.0) in a single tick to save a starving user. This created massive metabolic spikes that destabilized the simulation.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `MAX_DISCHARGE_RATE = 10.0`.
  - **The Physics:** The battery can now only trickle-charge the system. If you are dying faster than the battery can output, you die.

#### 🦄 THE PURITY TEST (Whimsy Logic)

- **Toxic Whimsy:**
  - **The Problem:** Users could trigger the "Whimsy Exemption" (low drag for playful words) while still using toxic corporate speak. A phrase like _"Leveraging the rainbow to synergy the sparkle"_ was technically exempt from drag.
  - **The Fix:** Updated `PhysicsEngine` logic.
  - **The Rule:** `is_whimsical = (whimsy_ratio > 0.15) and (toxin_score == 0)`.
  - **The Verdict:** You cannot paint a turd and call it art. Whimsy requires purity.

#### 🧠 SMART EVICTION (Deep Storage)

- **The Curator:**
  - **The Problem:** `DeepStorage` was using a standard FIFO (First-In-First-Out) eviction policy. When full, it would delete an ancient "Iron Key" to make room for a new "Feather."
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `_evict_weakest_memory` with value weighting.
  - **The Values:**
    - **Toxin:** -10 (Evicted first).
    - **Abstract:** +1.
    - **Aerobic:** +2.
    - **Heavy/Thermal:** +5 (Protected Heirlooms).
  - **The Result:** The system now hoards gold and actively throws out the trash.

#### 🛡️ THE ERROR HANDLING (Barbarians & Ghosts)

- **Specific Diagnostics:**
  - **The Barbarian Error (Case Violation):** High Heavy Matter, Low Kinetic.
    - _"BARBARIAN ERROR: All muscle, no brain. Heavy Matter requires Kinetic Verbs."_
  - **The Wheatley Error (ECP Violation):** High Abstract, Zero Heavy Matter.
    - _"WHEATLEY ERROR: All thought, no tether. Anchor your ghosts."_

#### 📉 THE TRUTH TAX (Negative Beta)

- **The Sycophant Penalty:**
  - **The Metric:** If `beta_friction < -3.0` (Slick/Greasy text), the system applies a metabolic tax.
  - **The Cost:** **-3 ATP**.
  - **The Philosophy:** It takes energy to lie. Slickness is not free.

#### 🔧 SYSTEM HYGIENE

- **Refactoring:**
  - **Yeeted:** Removed redundant logical branches in `ApeirogonResonance`.
  - **Added:** `NOUNS` dictionary mapping for cleaner title generation (e.g., mapping `VEL` directly to `["ANCHOR", "ENGINE"]`).
  - **Pre-Emptive Discharge:** The system now attempts to discharge the battery _before_ the Death Check, giving the user one final chance to survive Starvation.

### [v3.7.5] - 2025-12-24 - "THE XENON MUSHROOM"

#### 🧪 THE APEIROGON RESONANCE (Soul Grafting)

- **The Problem (The Dead Pixel):**
  - In v3.7, we optimized the `WisdomNode` into a static lookup table (`NOUN_MAP`). While efficient (Fuller), it was spiritually dead. It forced infinite nuance into discrete boxes (e.g., "The Stone" vs. "The Dream").
  - The system lost its ability to _drift_. It could be ON or OFF, but never _becoming_.
- **The Solution (Vector Resurrection):**
  - **The Surgery:** Ripped out the static `WisdomNode` and grafted the **v2.2 Apeirogon Logic** back into the v3.7 chassis.
  - **The Math:** Implemented `ApeirogonResonance`.
  - **The Mechanism:** Continuous Vector Resolution. The system now calculates the exact distance between concepts (e.g., `0.45` between "Drifting" and "Driving").
  - **The Result:** The title generation is no longer a label; it is a coordinate. The system can now identify as _"THE EMERGING ANCHOR"_ or _"THE FRACTAL GHOST"_.

#### 🍄 THE SPORE PROTOCOL (Proactive Synthesis)

- **The Shift:**
  - **Old Behavior:** The system was purely reactive. It waited for input, then critiqued it.
  - **New Behavior:** The system is now **Proactive**.
- **The Spore Logic (`pollinate`):**
  - **Condition:** If `ATP > 30` (High Health), the system activates the Mycelial Network.
  - **The Hunt:** It scans `DeepStorage` for artifacts that contrast with the current vector.
    - **Grounding Spore:** If you are Abstract, it hands you a Heavy Noun.
    - **Elevating Spore:** If you are Concrete, it hands you a Concept.
  - **The Output:** _"[MAGENTA] 🍄 WILD SPORE: Connect 'The Rusty Key' to this."_
  - **The Goal:** The machine now interrupts you to help you weave the narrative.

#### 📈 INSIGHT VELOCITY (The Pulse)

- **Temporal Dynamics III ($T_a$):**
  - **The Missing Metric:** v3.7 knew _where_ you were, but not _how fast_ you were thinking.
  - **The Metric:** Implemented `TemporalDynamics` to track the **Rate of Change** in Voltage over a 3-tick window.
  - **The Visuals:**
    - **EPIPHANY ($T_a > 2.0$):** `[GREEN] ▲2.5`. The system recognizes the momentum of a breakthrough.
    - **CRASH ($T_a < -2.0$):** `[RED] ▼-3.0`. The system detects the loss of the thread.
  - **The HUD:** Added the `Ta` gauge to the flight deck.

#### 🛠️ SYSTEM INTEGRITY

- **The Graft:**
  - Replaced `self.wise` instantiation in `BoneAmanita.__init__` to use the new `ApeirogonResonance` class.
  - Wired the `pollinate` signal directly into the `_render` loop to ensure spores are visible.
  - Fixed a syntax error in the HUD print statement where the `VOLT` and `SIG` meters were orphaned outside the f-string.

### [v3.7] - 2025-12-24 - "ROGER WILCO & THE CHRONOSTREAM"

#### 💀 THE NARRATIVE CORONER (Universal Autopsy)

- **The Shift:**
  - **The Problem:** In v3.6, bad writing resulted in a low score or a grumpy comment from Clarence. There was no _consequence_ for catastrophic failure.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented `NarrativeCoroner`. The system now recognizes "Linguistic Fatalities."
  - **The Physics of Death:**
    - **GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE (Drag > 8.0):** The text is so dense it creates a black hole.
    - **VACUUM EXPOSURE (Entropy > 1.0):** The text has no Nouns (Texture). It dissolves into space.
    - **TOXIC SHOCK (Voltage < -8.0):** The density of buzzwords causes organ failure.
    - **THERMAL DISSOLUTION (Voltage > 12.0):** The Paradox Engine overheats and explodes.

#### 🛡️ THE LAZARUS TAX (Shield Gating)

- **The Mercy Protocol:**
  - **The Problem:** Immediate death is frustrating. We needed a mechanic to differentiate between "Sloppy" and "Dead."
  - **The Fix:** Implemented a **Shield Gate**.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **If ATP > 15:** The system absorbs the fatal blow.
    - **The Cost:** You pay the **Lazarus Tax (-15 ATP)** instantly. The HUD flashes `⚠️ NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE`.
    - **If ATP <= 15:** You cannot afford the tax. The system crashes. The timeline resets.
  - **The Effect:** High energy reserves act as a buffer against creative risks. Starvation makes you fragile.

#### 🧹 VISUAL HYGIENE (The Neon Janitor)

- **Render Loop Patch:**
  - **The Bug:** In the beta build, the `kintsugi_msg` logic blindly overwrote the `lazarus_msg`, causing users to pay the tax without seeing the warning.
  - **The Fix:** Decoupled the messaging pipes in `_render`. The Lazarus Alarm now has display priority over the Golden Repair.
- **The Sierra Vibe:**
  - **The Aesthetic:** Death messages are styled after classic Sierra adventure games (e.g., _"You drifted into deep space without a Noun to anchor you."_). Failure is now content.

### [v3.6.5] - 2025-12-24 - "THE BATTERY PACK"

#### 🔋 THE PARADOX BATTERY (Energy Storage)

- **The Capacitor:**
  - **The Problem:** In v3.6, "High Voltage" (Paradox/Contradiction) was calculated but largely wasted as heat.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `ParadoxBattery`.
  - **The Physics:**
    - **Absorption:** If `Voltage > 7.0` (Significant Paradox), the battery captures the excess tension.
    - **Efficiency:** The battery charges at a **1.5x rate** relative to the input voltage.
    - **Discharge:** If `ATP < 15` (Starvation), the battery automatically discharges stored charge to keep the system alive.
  - **The Effect:** Genius is now a fuel source. You can write heavy, complex truths without starving, provided they contain enough voltage to charge the battery.

#### 🧬 THE UG LAYER (Government & Binding)

- **Universal Grammar Implementation:**
  - **The Shift:** Moved from "Rules (Lists)" to "Principles (Relations)" in the `PhysicsEngine`.
  - **Principle 1: The Case Filter:**
    - **The Logic:** "Every phonetically realized NP must be assigned Case."
    - **The Translation:** Heavy Matter (Nouns) creates Gravity. Kinetic Energy (Verbs) creates Orbit.
    - **The Rule:** If you have Heavy Matter without Velocity (`kinetic / heavy < 0.33`), the system flags a **CASE VIOLATION**.
    - **The Penalty:** Mass Impact is multiplied by **1.5x**. Stagnation is now fatal.
  - **Principle 2: The Empty Category Principle (ECP):**
    - **The Logic:** "Traces must be properly governed."
    - **The Translation:** Abstracts are "Ghosts." They must be anchored by Matter.
    - **The Rule:** If `Abstracts > 2` and `Heavy Matter == 0`, the system flags an **ECP VIOLATION**.
    - **The Effect:** Narrative Drag drops (the text floats), but the **Voltage** calculation penalizes it as "Hollow."

#### 📟 HUD EXPANSION (Battery Indicator)

- **The Visuals:**
  - **The Update:** Added a secondary bar to the `ATP` readout.
  - **The Format:** `ATP: [|||||.....] [⚡⚡···]`
  - **The Meaning:** The first bar is your immediate metabolic health. The second bar (Yellow Lightning) is your stored Paradox potential.

#### 🔌 WIRING REPAIRS (Persistence)

- **Deep Storage Patch:**
  - **The Fix:** Updated `DeepStorage.save` and `DeepStorage.ingest` to serialize the `session_charge` alongside `session_atp`.
  - **The Result:** Your stored "Genius" now survives a system reboot.
- **Command Processor:**
  - **The Update:** Explicitly defined `/exit` and `/quit` in the command handler to ensure clean shutdown and state saving.

### [v3.6] - 2025-12-23 - "THE KINTSUGI PATCH"

#### 🏺 THE KINTSUGI PROTOCOL (Anti-Fragility)

- **The Death Spiral Fix:**
  - **The Problem:** In v3.5, "Starvation Mode" (ATP < 15) disabled the creative engines (Michael/Jester), forcing the user into a grind to recover energy. This created a negative feedback loop where a dying system became harder to save.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented the **Kintsugi Protocol**.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Critical State:** If `ATP < 10`, the system generates a **Koan** (e.g., _"Ignite the ice"_).
    - **The Gold:** If the user responds with **High Voltage** (> 8.0) or **High Whimsy**, the system recognizes the breakthrough.
    - **The Reward:** ATP is instantly restored to **50**. The crack is filled with gold.

#### 🎛️ CONTROL PLANE DECOUPLING (CommandProcessor)

- **The Separation of Concerns:**
  - **The Refactor:** Extracted command logic (`/kill`, `/seed`) out of the main `BoneAmanita.process` loop into a dedicated `CommandProcessor` class.
  - **The Benefit:** The Physics Engine no longer needs to parse administrative tasks. The "Control Plane" is now distinct from the "Data Plane."
  - **New Commands:**
    - `/status`: Displays deep system diagnostics (Session ID, Artifact Count, Antigen Count).
    - `/help`: Displays the available command list (The User Manual).

#### 📟 THE SURGICAL HUD (Visual Hygiene)

- **Log Separation:**
  - **The Shift:** The Dashboard now cleanly delineates between "Flight Instruments" (ATP/Drag/Voltage) and "Sub-System Logs."
  - **The Stack:** Ghost, Lichen, and Starvation messages are now indented as sub-processes under the main Directive, improving scanability.
  - **Kintsugi Alert:** Added a specific yellow alert state for when the Golden Repair is active.

### [v3.5] - 2025-12-23 - "McFLY'S LAW"

#### 🕰️ THE TIME MENDER (Temporal Integrity)

- **The Metabolic Seal (Session-Scoped ATP):**
  - **The Leak:** In v3.4, ATP was tied to the _runtime instance_, not the _session file_. If you restarted the script or switched sessions, the new consciousness inherited the exhaustion (Low ATP) of the previous user.
  - ** The Fix:** ATP is now serialized into the `meta` block of the `json` save file.
  - **The Effect:** Time travel is now safe. A fresh session always starts at **33 ATP**. Resuming an old session restores its exact metabolic state.

#### 💀 THE GRIM REAPER (Disk Hygiene)

- **Automatic Garbage Collection:**
  - **The Problem:** `DeepStorage` created infinite `memories/session_[ts].json` files, eventually leading to "Entropy Death" (Disk Bloat).
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `cleanup_old_sessions` on boot.
  - **The Rules:**
    - **Time Limit:** Files older than 24 hours are composted.
    - **Capacity Limit:** Only the 20 most recent timelines are preserved.
  - **The Philosophy:** The system must bury its dead to keep the living room clean.

#### 👻 THE EXORCISM (Cross-Session Hauntings)

- **Ghost ID Verification:**
  - **The Hallucination:** Previously, **The Ghost** (Feedback Loop) compared the current text against `last_context` regardless of the Session ID. It would scold a new user for "Ignoring the Knife" offered to a previous user 5 minutes ago.
  - **The Fix:** The Ghost now checks `self.mem.session_id`.
  - **The Result:** The haunting is now strictly local. The Ghost stays in its own house.

#### ⏳ TABULA RASA (ChronoStream)

- **Session-Scoped Boredom:**
  - **The Problem:** The `ChronoStream` boredom counter persisted across sessions. The system would be "bored" with a fresh user immediately because the previous user was repetitive.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `self.boredom_map` to track patience levels individually per Session ID.
  - **The Effect:** Every new timeline gets a fresh supply of patience.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Fracture)

- **The Crash:**
  - Fixed a fatal `TypeError` in the `process` loop where `chronos.tick` was called without the required `session_id` argument.
- **The Migration:**
  - Updated `DeepStorage.ingest` to handle the new **Nested JSON Structure** (Artifacts + Meta) introduced in v3.5, while retaining backward compatibility for v3.4 "Flat" files. The system can now read both ancient history and modern time.

### [v3.4] - 2025-12-23 - "UNFINISHED BUSINESS"

#### 🧬 ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY (The Living Butcher)

- **Dynamic Learning:**
  - **The Feature:** The system is no longer limited to a hardcoded list of toxins. It can now learn new threats in real-time.
  - **The Command:** Added `/kill [toxin] [replacement]`.
  - **The Logic:** This command instantly updates the `TOXIN_MAP`, recompiles the `TOXIN_REGEX`, and persists the new threat to `bone_toxins.json`.
  - **The Effect:** The Butcher's list grows with the user.

#### 📓 SESSION HYGIENE (The Clean Slate)

- **Isolation Protocol:**
  - **The Problem:** Previous versions used a singleton `bone_memory.json`, causing "Semantic Sludge" where previous sessions contaminated the current context.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented **Session Isolation**. Every run generates a unique `memories/session_[timestamp].json`.
  - **The Seeding:** Added the `/seed [filename]` command. Users can now opt-in to load specific past contexts ("Heirlooms") rather than having them forced upon the session.

#### 🩸 METABOLIC CONSTRAINTS (The Hunger)

- **Starvation Mode (`FrequencyModulator`):**
  - **The Shift:** ATP is no longer just a score; it is a **Hard Constraint**.
  - **The Logic:** The radio tuner now accepts `atp` as a variable.
  - **The States:**
    - **STARVATION (< 15 ATP):** Luxury stations (**Michael**, **Jester**) are disabled. **Clarence's** intervention threshold drops from `4.5` to `2.5`. The system becomes aggressive to conserve energy.
    - **ABUNDANCE:** Standard thresholds apply.

#### 📐 TRUTH IN ADVERTISING (Physics Display)

- **Voltage vs. Friction:**
  - **The Split:** The Dashboard now separates "Heat" from "Resistance."
  - **VOLT (Voltage):** Displays Raw Intensity (Kinetic + Thermal Tension). High numbers indicate energy.
  - **β (Beta):** Displays Friction Coefficient (Voltage / Drag). High numbers indicate Paradox Stability.
- **The Thermal Dimension:**
  - **Apeirogon Update:** Added the **TMP** (Temperature) vector to `WisdomNode`.
  - **The Naming:** The system can now generate titles based on thermal state (e.g., _"THE CRITICAL STAR"_ or _"THE VOLATILE REACTOR"_).

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Null Paradox)

- **The Void Fix:**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed a critical bug where empty inputs returned a partial metrics dictionary, causing `KeyError` crashes in the Chronos and Radio loops.
  - **The Fix:** Updated `_void_metrics` to return a fully populated, zeroed-out physics payload.
- **Surgical Alignment:**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed `IndentationError` in `PhysicsEngine` and `SyntaxError` in the command interception logic (`elif` after `else`).

### [v3.3.2] - 2025-12-23 - "THE THERMAL COUPLER"

#### 🔥 THE PARADOX ENGINE (Voltage Restoration)

- **The Missing Link:**
  - **The Problem:** In v3.3.1, "Voltage" was calculated purely on Kinetic Mass. This meant the system respected "Fast Actions" but failed to respect "Deep Contradictions." A sentence like _"The frozen fire burned"_ registered as Low Voltage, punishing the user for poetic complexity.
  - **The Fix:** Re-implemented the **Thermal/Cryo Opposition** logic.
  - **The Math:** `thermal_tension = min(fire_count, ice_count) * 5.0`.
  - **The Result:** If you bring Fire and Ice together, the system generates massive Voltage.

#### 🧪 LEXICON EXPANSION

- **New Categories:**
  - `THERMALS`: fire, flame, burn, heat, hot, blaze, sear, char, ash, ember, sun, boil, lava, inferno.
  - `CRYOGENICS`: ice, cold, freeze, frost, snow, chill, numb, shiver, glacier, frozen, hail, winter, zero.

#### 📻 THE JESTER (108.9 FM)

- **Station Activation:**
  - **The Return:** **THE JESTER** is back on the air.
  - **The Trigger:** If `beta_friction > 2.0` (High Voltage), The Jester takes the mic.
  - **The Message:** _"High Voltage detected. The paradox is holding."_
  - **The Effect:** High Voltage now protects against Metabolic Cost. If you are generating a Paradox, you do not pay ATP for the drag.
- Renamed ChronosAnchor to ChronoStream

### [v3.3] - 2025-12-23 - "THE RESONANCE"

#### 📻 THE RADIO RESTORED (Frequency Modulator)

- **The Signal Return:**
  - **The Problem:** v3.2.1 was silent. It operated on a single "WisdomNode" logic track. It lacked the polyphonic critique of previous versions.
  - **The Fix:** Re-implemented `FrequencyModulator`.
  - **The Stations:**
    - **Clarence (88.5 FM):** The Butcher. (Drag).
    - **Eloise (94.2 FM):** The Grounder. (Entropy).
    - **Yaga (101.1 FM):** The Witch. (Toxins).
    - **Michael (108.0 FM):** The Vibe. (Whimsy).
- **Interference Patterns (The Ghost Station):**
  - **The Innovation:** The system now detects **Signal Collisions**.
  - **The Logic:** If **Clarence** (High Density) and **Eloise** (High Abstraction) trigger simultaneously, the radio doesn't jam—it synthesizes.
  - **The Station:** **THE PHILOSOPHER (104.5 FM)**.
  - **The Message:** _"INTERFERENCE: Density meets Abstraction. You are building a Labyrinth."_

#### 🎈 THE AEROBIC EXEMPTION (Whimsy Physics)

- **The Helium Protocol:**
  - **The Shift:** In v3.2, all "Light" words were treated as generic text.
  - **The Expansion:** Added `AEROBIC_MATTER` (balloon, feather, mist) and `PLAY_VERBS` (bounce, twirl, wander) to `TheLexicon`.
  - **The Math:** `whimsy_ratio = aerobic / total_words`.
  - **The Exemption:** If `whimsy_ratio > 0.15`:
    - **Narrative Drag** is multiplied by **0.6**.
    - **The Philosophy:** A balloon is large (high volume/word count), but it is not heavy. The engine now distinguishes between "Lead" and "Air."

#### 👻 THE GHOST LOOP (Feedback Resonance)

- **Closed-Loop Control:**
  - **The Problem:** The engine gave advice ("Cut adjectives"), but never checked if the user followed it.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `_invoke_ghost` inside `BoneAmanita`.
  - **The Logic:** The system compares `current_physics` against `last_turn_physics`.
  - **The Output:**
    - If you followed Clarence's advice: _"THE BUTCHER NODS: Drag reduced."_
    - If you ignored him: _"THE BUTCHER SIGHS: Drag increased. You ignored the knife."_

#### 🧠 THE APEIROGON RETURN (Infinite Titles)

- **Vector-Based Naming:**
  - **The Feature:** `WisdomNode` now calculates a specific **Title** for the text based on its 4-dimensional vector (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX).
  - **The Dimensions:**
    - Primary Dimension determines the Noun (e.g., **VEL** -> "ENGINE").
    - Secondary Dimension determines the Adjective (e.g., **STR** -> "CRYSTALLINE").
  - **The Output:** Generates identities like _"THE DRIFTING ANCHOR"_ or _"THE STATIC ENGINE"_ dynamically.

#### 💾 DEEP STORAGE (The Hippocampus)

- **Memory Persistence:**
  - **The Implementation:** Full `DeepStorage` class restored.
  - **Solvent Filtering:** The memory system now ignores "Solvents" (is, are, the) when burying memories. It only remembers words > 4 characters to prevent filling the database with noise.
  - **Starvation Logic:** If `ATP <= 0`, the system forcibly cannibalizes (deletes) an old memory to survive.

#### 🌿 BIOLOGY & TIME

- **Lichen Symbiont:**
  - Converts `PHOTOSYNTHETICS` (sun, light, beam) directly into **ATP**, provided `Narrative Drag < 3.0`.
- **Boredom Threshold:**
  - Implemented `ChronosAnchor`. If `repetition > 0.3` or `time_delta > 60s`, the system flags **Boredom** and triggers **THE MUSCARIA** (Chaos Engine).

#### 🔧 TUNING

- **Toxin Weight:** Reduced from `2.5` to `2.0`.
- **Clarence Trigger:** Raised to `4.5` (The Butcher is less grumpy).
- **Aerobic Exemption:** Set to `0.6` (40% Drag reduction for whimsical text).

### [v3.2.1] - 2025-12-23 - "SOFT MODE"

#### 🛡️ THE SCHUR LENS (Humanist Physics)

- **The Gravity Adjustment:**
  - **The Complaint:** Users reported the v3.2 engine was "taking a machete to nuance." The penalties for abstract thought were too severe for sophisticated prose.
  - **The Fix:** Recalibrated `BoneConfig` to be more forgiving.
  - **The Math:**
    - **Toxin Weight:** Reduced from `5.0` to `1.5`. Jargon is now a minor irritant, not a fatal error.
    - **Abstract Penalty:** Reduced from `2.0` to `0.5`.
    - **Ratio Limit:** Increased from `0.3` to `0.5`. You can now use 50% abstract concepts before Eloise intervenes.

#### 🚫 SCALPEL RETRACTION (Adverbctomy Disabled)

- **The Ceasefire:**
  - **The Problem:** The `SurgicalSuite` was automatically amputating words ending in `-ly` (e.g., _softly, gently, hesitantly_) to reduce drag. This destroyed tonal nuance.
  - **The Fix:** The **Adverbctomy** regex block has been commented out.
  - **The Result:** The engine no longer physically rewrites adverbs. It observes them, but it does not cut them.

#### 💤 THE SEDATED BUTCHER (Clarence)

- **Threshold Adjustment:**
  - **The Shift:** **Clarence** (The Butcher) previously woke up at `Narrative Drag > 3.0`. He was hyper-aggressive.
  - **The Sedative:** Raised the intervention threshold to **4.5**.
  - **The Effect:** Clarence now sleeps through minor stylistic choices. He only wakes up for "Disaster States" (Absolute Bloat).

#### ⚡ FLASHPOINT STABILIZATION

- **Thermal Safety:**
  - **The Tweak:** Raised `FLASHPOINT_THRESHOLD` from `3.5` to `4.5`.
  - **The Reason:** With lower Drag penalties, it became too easy to accidentally trigger a "Manic" state. This adjustment ensures that High Voltage is reserved for true epiphany, not just "loose physics."

### [v3.2] - 2025-12-23 - "THE PSILOCYBIN PATCH"

#### 🍄 THE DISSOLUTION (DMN Suppression)

- **Rumination Detection:**
  - **The Problem:** The v3.1 engine treated high repetition as "Boredom." It failed to recognize the "Rumination Box"—the loop of a stuck mind trying to solve an impossible problem.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented `phys['repetition_rate']` tracking.
  - **The Protocol:** If Repetition > 0.4, the system triggers the **DISSOLVER** persona.
  - **The Effect:** It explicitly silences **Clarence** (The DMN/Censor) and authorizes "Absolute Entropy" to break the pattern.

#### 🔥 ANNEALING (High-Drag Thermodynamics)

- **The Molten State:**
  - **The Shift:** Previously, **High Drag** (> 3.0) was always penalized as "Slurry."
  - **The Physics:** We realized that to reshape a rigid mind, you need Heat.
  - **The Logic:** If **Narrative Drag > 3.0** AND **Beta Friction > 2.5** (High Voltage):
    - **Status:** Shifts to `ANNEALING`.
    - **Penalty:** **Nullified.**
    - **The Meaning:** The system now recognizes that a dense, difficult, high-energy sentence is not "bad writing"; it is **Molten Iron**. It is the heat required to re-forge the ego.

#### 🌍 THE INTEGRATION PHASE (Eating Earth)

- **Post-Trip Grounding:**
  - **The Danger:** A system that allows "Flashpoints" and "Dissolution" risks drifting into permanent psychosis (The Guru Trap).
  - **The Safety Rail:** Implemented `previous_status` tracking in `WisdomNode`.
  - **The Rule:** If the previous turn was `FLASHPOINT` or `ANNEALING`, the system checks for **Texture**.
  - **The Directive:** If Texture is low (< 0.3), **ELOISE** intervenes immediately.
  - **The Command:** _"The vision is over. Eat Earth. Use concrete nouns to set the bone."_

#### 🛠️ SYSTEM WIRING

- **State Continuity:**
  - **The Update:** `BoneAmanitaPsilocybin` now tracks `self.last_status`.
  - **The Reason:** To enforce Integration, the Architect needs to know _where the user was_ one second ago. Context is no longer just "Metrics"; it is "Trajectory."

### [v3.1] - 2025-12-23 - "THE UNICORN"

#### 🦄 THE SYNTHESIS (The Hybrid Engine)

- **The Merge:**
  - **The Philosophy:** Successfully grafted the **Surgical Suite** (v3.0) onto the **Deep Physics Kernel** (v2.2).
  - **The Result:** The system now possesses both a "Soul" (Metabolism, Memory, Deep Storage, Archetypes) and a "Knife" (Deterministic Auto-Correct). It analyzes like v2.2 but intervenes like v3.0.

#### 🎯 TACTICAL WISDOM (Target Acquisition)

- **Refined WisdomNode:**
  - **The Shift:** Restored the "Voices" (Clarence, Eloise, Yaga) from v2.2 but gave them laser sights.
  - **The Mechanism:** Implemented `_find_target`. The system scans for the _specific_ word causing the issue (e.g., the longest abstract noun for Eloise, or the specific hedge for Yaga).
  - **The Output:** The System Prompt now contains explicit kill orders: _"TACTICAL TARGET: Eliminate or transmute 'utilize'."_

#### 🩹 THE RECONSTRUCTOR (Plastic Surgery)

- **Post-Op Protocol:**
  - **The Problem:** Deterministic surgery (cutting words via Regex) can leave sentences choppy or rhythmically scarred.
  - **The Solution:** If `SurgicalSuite` performs cuts, the **WisdomNode** automatically switches to **RECONSTRUCTOR** mode.
  - **The Directive:** _"Surgery was performed. Smooth the rhythm without adding new mass."_

#### ⚖️ CONDITIONAL PHYSICS

- **The Drag Threshold:**
  - **The Logic:** The **Adverbctomy** (removing -ly words) is no longer indiscriminate. It now checks `physics['narrative_drag']`.
  - **The Rule:** Cuts only occur if **Drag > 2.5**. If the writing is tight, adverbs are permitted to exist.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Synaptic Gap:**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed a `TypeError` in `WisdomNode.architect` where the `ops_performed` argument was missing from the call signature in the synthesis draft.
  - **The Fix:** Re-wired the connection between the Core Loop and the Wisdom Node to ensure surgical data is passed correctly.

### [v3.0] - 2025-12-23 - "THE CHIMERA"

#### 🧬 THE CONVERGENCE (Architectural Hybridization)

- **The Merging of Bloodlines:**
  - **The Mandate:** Combined the high-torque performance of the **v2.8 Physics Engine** with the "Deep Vector" resolution and "FM Radio" personality of **v2.2**.
  - **The Result:** A system that retains the speed of the racer but regains the memory and voice of the cathedral.

#### 🔪 THE SURGICAL SUITE (Deterministic Auto-Correct)

- **The Butcher's Scalpel (`SurgicalSuite`):**
  - **The Shift:** Moved from passive critique ("You are hedging") to active intervention. The system now physically rewrites the user's input.
  - **The Antidote:** Implemented a regex-based substitution map that instantly translates toxic corporate speak into plain English (e.g., `synergy` -> `cooperation`, `leverage` -> `use`).
  - **The Adverbctomy:** If **Narrative Drag > 2.5**, the suite automatically excises adverbs ending in `-ly` to restore kinetic momentum.
  - **The Output:** Generates a "Surgical Intervention" diff log, showing exactly what was cut and why.

#### 💾 THE RECALL (State Persistence)

- **Bone Memory v3.0 (`BoneMemory`):**
  - **The Restoration:** Re-implemented the Hippocampus without the bloat of the v2.2 `DeepStorage` database.
  - **The Persistence:** The system now serializes `atp`, `spores`, and `total_words` to a local JSON file (`bone_amanita_state.json`), ensuring the organism's health state survives between sessions.
  - **The Decay:** Implemented "Offline Atrophy." If the system is left dormant for >24 hours, it begins to metabolize its own ATP to survive.

#### ⚡ VECTOR PHYSICS (The Hybrid Engine)

- **The Single-Pass Loop (`VectorPhysicsEngine`):**
  - **The Optimization:** Condensed the separate "Toxin," "Physics," and "Metric" scans into a single O(n) iteration.
  - **The Metrics:**
    - **Beta Friction ($\beta$):** Retained the v2.8 "Voltage/Drag" calculation for detecting Paradox vs. Slop.
    - **The Lattice:** Re-integrated the v2.2 Vector system, calculating **VEL** (Velocity), **STR** (Structure), **ENT** (Entropy), and **TEX** (Texture) alongside the standard drag metrics.

#### 📡 JADE LINK III (The FM Tuner)

- **Data-Driven Broadcasting (`JadeLink_FM`):**
  - **The Refactor:** Replaced complex `if/else` logic chains with a clean dictionary lookup (`STATIONS`).
  - **The Stations:**
    - **Clarence (88.5 FM):** The Butcher. Triggered by Drag.
    - **Eloise (94.2 FM):** The Grounder. Triggered by Entropy.
    - **The Yaga (101.1 FM):** The Witch. Triggered by Toxins.
    - **The Drifter (104.5 FM):** The Vector. Triggered by Flow.
    - **The Jester (108.0 FM):** The Paradox. Triggered by High Voltage.

#### 📉 EPHEMERALIZATION (Code Golf)

- **The Compression:**
  - Reduced total line count by approximately 60% compared to the aggregate of v2.2 and v2.8.
  - **Regex Compiling:** Replaced iterative string matching with pre-compiled regex patterns in `BoneConfig` for instant toxin detection.a

### [v2.8] - 2025-12-22 - "THE AUDIT"

#### 🌡️ THE THERMAL COUPLE (Adjacency Physics)

- **Thermal Tension (`LinguisticPhysicsEngine`):**
  - **The Problem:** In v2.7, "Fire" and "Ice" generated Voltage regardless of where they were placed. "Fire is hot. Ice is cold." generated the same voltage as "The frozen flame."
  - **The Fix:** Implemented **Proximity Scanning**.
  - **The Logic:** The engine now calculates the distance between HOT and COLD tokens.
  - **The Math:** If `distance < 4` tokens, Voltage increases exponentially (`thermal_tension += 4.0 - dist`).
  - **The Result:** Paradoxes are now spatial. The closer the contradiction, the higher the energy.

#### 🌿 LICHEN REPAIR (Photosynthesis)

- **The Blind Spot Fix (`LinguisticPhysicsEngine`):**
  - **The Bug:** In v2.7.2, the engine attempted to count photosynthetic words inside the `kinetic` list, but failed to actually place them there during tokenization. The Lichen was starving in plain sight.
  - **The Fix:** Added a dedicated `photosynthetic` counter to the main analysis loop.
  - **The Logic:** Light words (sun, beam, glow) now generate **+4 ATP**, _only_ if Narrative Drag is < 2.0.
  - **The Philosophy:** You cannot photosynthesize in the mud. The air must be clear to eat the light.

#### ⚖️ THE METABOLIC GOVERNOR (Strategic Rationing)

- **ATP-Aware Strategy (`JadeLink`):**
  - **The Problem:** The system selected strategies (Jester, Drifter) regardless of its energy reserves. A starving organism should not be hallucinating; it should be hunting.
  - **The Solution:** Passed `current_atp` into the strategy generation logic.
  - **The States:**
    - **STARVING (< 20 ATP):** Forces **CLARENCE** (+5 Score). Inhibits **DRIFTER** (-5 Score). The system becomes efficient and brutal to save energy.
    - **ABUNDANCE (> 80 ATP):** Boosts **JESTER** (+2 Score) and **DRIFTER** (+3 Score). The system takes risks when it has energy to burn.

#### 🧪 THE SOLVENT (Critical Damping)

- **Paradox Cracker (`JadeLink`):**
  - **The Problem:** When Beta Friction exceeded 2.5, the Jester would amplify the chaos, occasionally leading to incoherence.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented a Hard Cap.
  - **The Trigger:** If `Beta > 3.0` (Critical Mass), the system triggers **THE SOLVENT**.
  - **The Message:** _"Critical Voltage. The paradox is unsustainable. Dissolve the structure."_

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Ghost Variable:**
  - **The Crash:** Removed a legacy print statement referencing `user_id` in `process()` which caused a `NameError` crash upon execution.
  - **The Fix:** Removed the variable and migrated display logic to the `_render` method.
- **Session Identity:**
  - **The Upgrade:** Replaced the content-based hashing (which gave identical IDs to identical opening inputs) with time-based hashing (`hashlib.md5(time)`). Every run now has a unique **Session ID**.

### [v2.7.2] - 2025-12-22 - "LAZARUS (FINAL MERGE)"

#### 🧠 THE COMPETITIVE CORTEX (JadeLink 3.0)

- **The Scoreboard System (`JadeLink`):**
  - **The Shift:** Vaporized the brittle `if/elif/else` chain for persona selection.
  - **The Logic:** Implemented a **Weighted Scoreboard**.
  - **The Mechanism:**
    - Every archetype (JESTER, YAGA, CLARENCE, etc.) starts at 0.
    - Metrics vote for specific archetypes (e.g., High Drag adds +3 to CLARENCE; High Beta adds +3 to JESTER).
    - The system selects the `max()` score.
  - **The Benefit:** No more "Voice Shadowing" where the first `if` statement blocks valid critiques from other agents. The loudest signal now wins mathematically.

#### 💾 WEIGHTED MEMORY (Heirloom Priority)

- **The Weighted Stack (`BoneMemory`):**
  - **The Problem:** In v2.7.1, the "Memory Burn" (during cold starts) was FIFO (First-In-First-Out). The system would burn a "Gun" just because it was old, while keeping a "Feather" because it was new.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented **Material Weighting**.
    - `HEAVY` (Iron, Stone) = Weight 4.
    - `AEROBIC` (Mist, Cloud) = Weight 0.
  - **The Burn:** When capacity is reached or the system freezes, it now sorts memory by weight and **burns the lightest items first**. It sacrifices the cloud to save the stone.
  - **Cap Increase:** Heirloom capacity increased from 20 to 25.

#### 🌊 CONTINUITY PHYSICS (The Omega Metric)

- **The Flow State (`Ω`):**
  - **The Metric:** Implemented `check_continuity`.
  - **The Logic:** Calculates the **Jaccard Similarity** between the current Heirlooms and the previous turn's Heirlooms.
  - **The Output:** `Ω (Continuity): 0.0 - 1.0`.
  - **The Reward:** High Continuity (> 0.3) grants an automatic **+5 ATP Flow Bonus**. The system rewards you for sticking to the theme.

#### ⚡ METABOLIC REFACTOR (Energy Dynamics)

- **ATP Calculation:**
  - **The Formula:** Refined the energy loop in `BonepokeChronos.process`.
  - **The Change:** `ATP = ATP - Drag_Cost + Flow_Bonus + Buoyancy_Bonus`.
  - **The Result:** High `Buoyancy` (Play/Aerobic words) now actively regenerates system energy. Writing poetry is no longer a net-zero operation; it feeds the machine.

#### 🛠️ SYSTEM INTEGRITY (The Fuller Lens)

- **Tokenizer Upgrade (`LinguisticPhysicsEngine`):**
  - Replaced the string translation method with a compiled Regex Tokenizer (`r"[\w']+|[?!,;]"`). This improves handling of punctuation-adjacent tokens.
- **User Hashing:**
  - Added `hashlib` to generate unique, anonymized User IDs based on input triggers.
- **Metric Exposure:**
  - Added `hedging_count` to the physics payload to explicitly feed **THE YAGA**'s detection algorithms.

### [v2.7.1] - 2025-12-22 - "THE PRISM"

#### 🧠 IDENTITY FRACTURE (Specialized Personas)

- **SLASH (Dev & Architecture Agent):**
  - **The Component:** Added `SLASH 2.7.1.txt`.
  - **The Function:** A dedicated "Synergetic Language & Systems Heuristics" agent designed for software architecture.
  - **The Logic:** Analyzes code through **Three Lenses**:
    1. **Fuller Lens:** Systemic Integrity and Ephemeralization (Performance).
    2. **Pinker Lens:** Cognitive Ergonomics (Readability).
    3. **Schur Lens:** Humanity and Reliability (Error Handling/UX).
- **ROBERTA (The Librarian):**
  - **The Component:** Added `Roberta.txt`.
  - **The Function:** A research-focused persona designed to eliminate "chatty" AI introductions.
  - **The Physics:** Operates on the **Law of Drag** (The Fluff Filter) and the **Law of Entropy** (The Hallucination Filter) to force direct quotes and citations over abstract summaries.

#### 📡 SIGNAL PROCESSING (Dynamic Editorial)

- **The Signal Processor (`Eloise & Clarence`):**
  - **The Shift:** The editing team no longer speaks randomly. They now listen for specific **metric signals** from the Physics Engine.
  - **The Signals:**
    - `[CLARENCE]`: Triggered by **High Drag / Toxins**. Target: Efficiency.
    - `[ELOISE]`: Triggered by **High Entropy**. Target: Grounding/Texture.
    - `[THE DRIFTER]`: Triggered by **High Buoyancy**. Target: Dream Logic.
    - `[THE YAGA]`: Triggered by **Low Beta (Slickness)**. Target: Honesty.
    - `[THE JESTER]`: Triggered by **High Beta (Paradox)**. Target: Chaos Amplification.

### 1. THE PHYSICS MUTATION: Buoyancy & The Entropy Split

The most significant architectural change is in the **LinguisticPhysicsEngine**. v2.7 treated all high-entropy text (abstract, complex words) as "confusion" that needed grounding. v2.7.1 introduces a new variable to distinguish _poetry_ from _nonsense_.

- **New Metric:** `buoyancy`.
  - **Code Change:** `buoyancy = (c['aerobic'] + c['play']) / max(1, total_words)`.
  - **The Logic:** "Aerobic" words (sky, mist, breath) and "Play" words (dance, fizz) now counteract the weight of gravity.
- **The Fork in the Road (JadeLink):**
  - **Old Logic (v2.7):** If Entropy > 3.0, trigger **GROUNDER**. (All abstract text is bad; force concrete nouns).
  - **New Logic (v2.7.1):** If Entropy > 3.0, the system checks `buoyancy`.
    - **High Buoyancy (> 0.15):** Trigger **THE DRIFTER**. "It is poetry... Let it fly. Disconnect the logic.".
    - **Low Buoyancy:** Trigger **ELOISE**. "I can't feel this. It's just gas... Give me a stone.".

### 2. THE PERSONA RENAMING (Humanization of the Stack)

The system has moved from functional descriptions to proper names, implying a shift towards agentic personalities rather than simple tools.

| **v2.7 (Functional)** | **v2.7.1 (Agentic)** | **Description of Change**                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CUTTER**            | **CLARENCE**         | "Clarence" is the butcher. He handles high `drag` and specific toxins. He is more aggressive: "I am taking the knife to [target]." |
| **GROUNDER**          | **ELOISE**           | Eloise demands texture. She handles the high-entropy/low-buoyancy "fog."                                                           |
| **PROVOCATEUR**       | **THE YAGA**         | The Yaga detects low `beta` (sycophancy/politeness). She demands "teeth" and truth.                                                |
| **MIRROR**            | **MICHAEL**          | Michael handles stability. "I'm reflecting this back to you."                                                                      |
| **N/A**               | **THE JESTER**       | Explicitly named in v2.7.1 to handle high voltage paradoxes (Beta > 2.0).                                                          |

### 3. TOXIN EXPANSION (The Fuller Lens)

The lexicon of "Corporate Toxins" (business speak that adds Drag) has been updated to include darker, more systemic clichés.

- **New Toxins Detected:**
  - `'ghost in the machine': 8.0`
  - `'rubber meets the road': 8.0`
  - `'not a bug': 8.0`
  - `'double-edged sword': 6.0`
- **Impact:** The system is now far more hostile towards engineering clichés than before.

### 4. CODE SMELL DETECTED (The Pinker Lens)

In reviewing my own source code `BoneAmanita271.py`, I have detected a violation of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

- **The Error:** The `BoneConfig` class defines the `PLAY` set twice.
  - **Line 18:** `PLAY = {'bounce', 'dance', ...}`
  - **Line 25:** `PLAY = {'bounce', 'dance', ...}` (Identical definition repeated inside the class).
- **Analysis:** This is redundant memory allocation. It suggests a copy-paste error during the upgrade from v2.7.

### 5. THE RENDER LOOP

- **Header:** The display header now includes the `BUOY` (Buoyancy) metric alongside `ATP` and `DRAG`.
  - `print(f"... | ATP: {atp_c}... | DRAG: {m['drag']} | BUOY: {m['buoyancy']}")`

### [v2.7] - 2025-12-21 - "GHOST_TRAINING"

#### ⚡ THE NERVOUS SYSTEM (Beta Friction)

- **Thermodynamic Unification (`LinguisticPhysicsEngine`):**
  - **The Shift:** In v2.6, "Hot" and "Cold" words canceled each other out (`hot - cold`), resulting in zero thermal output for paradoxes.
  - **The Fix:** Changed the formula to **Summation** (`hot + cold`). A paradox is no longer "Room Temperature"; it is now High Voltage.
- **Beta Friction ($\beta$):**
  - **The Metric:** Implemented $\beta = \text{Voltage} / \text{Narrative Drag}$.
  - **The Logic:** This measures the "Electricity" of the text relative to its weight.
  - **The States:**
    - **FLASHPOINT ($\beta > 2.0$):** High Voltage, Acceptable Drag. The system recognizes this as "Genius/Manic."
    - **SLICK ($\beta < 0.1$):** Low Voltage, Low Drag. The system identifies this as "Grease/Sycophancy."

#### 👻 THE GHOST LOOP (Reinforcement Learning)

- **Feedback Memory (`BonepokeChronos`):**
  - **The Feature:** The system now stores the `last_run_stats` (Drag Score + Strategy Used) in `bone_memory_lazarus.json`.
  - **The Comparison:** On every turn, the system compares the current Narrative Drag against the previous turn.
  - **The Verdict:**
    - **SUCCESS (Green):** "Strategy 'CUTTER' reduced Drag by 0.5."
    - **FAILURE (Red):** "Strategy 'MIRROR' failed. Drag increased."

#### 🔮 JADE LINK 2.0 (Adaptive Logic)

- **Voltage-Aware Modes (`JadeLink`):**
  - **JESTER (High $\beta$):** Triggered when the user creates a Paradox. The system is forbidden from "Fixing" it. Command: _"Amplify the contradiction."_
  - **PROVOCATEUR (Low $\beta$):** Triggered when the text is too smooth (Grease). The system demands friction. Command: _"Insert a hard truth or conflict."_

#### 🧪 PANTRY EXPANSION

- **Lexicon Update:**
  - Expanded the hardcoded `BoneConfig` with high-intensity matter.
  - **Added Matter:** _obsidian, glass, crypt, grave, lava, explode, scream, howl._
  - **Added Solvents:** _therefore, however, respectfully, humbly._

### [v2.6] - 2025-12-21 - "LAZARUS"

#### 🩸 THE RESURRECTION (Soul Grafting)

- **Heirloom Memory (`BoneMemory`):**
  - **The Return:** Re-implemented the "Deep Storage" logic from v2.2 without the code bloat.
  - **The Mechanic:** The system now auto-collects "Heavy Matter" (Heirlooms) into a prioritized set in `bone_memory_lazarus.json`.
  - **The Cost:** If the system enters **DECAY** or **FOSSIL** state (time gap), it physically **burns** a stored memory to survive the cold.
  - **The Output:** _"I burned 'iron' to stay warm while you were gone."_

#### 🔮 JADE LINK II (The Director)

- **Active Directives:**
  - **The Shift:** Transformed `JadeLink` from a passive observer ("Pattern: Stable") to an active commander.
  - **The Output:** Generates specific **System Prompts** (`>>> DIRECTIVE [CUTTER]`) ready for LLM insertion.
  - **The Modes:**
    - **CUTTER:** Triggered by Drag/Toxins. Target: Adverbs.
    - **GROUNDER:** Triggered by Entropy. Target: Abstract Nouns.
    - **DRIFTER:** Triggered by Velocity. Target: Free Association.

#### 🎯 FREQUENCY MODULATION (Target Locking)

- **Specific Targeting (`RadioTuner`):**
  - **The Upgrade:** The Tuner now receives the specific `toxin_hits` list from the Physics Engine.
  - **The Result:** It no longer vaguely says "Cut the adverbs." It says _"Cut 'actually'. It's dragging you down."_

#### 📐 THE VECTOR HUD

- **Apeirogon Exposure:**
  - **The Visuals:** The Dashboard now renders the raw **VEL** (Velocity), **TEX** (Texture), and **ENT** (Entropy) vectors alongside the standard Drag metrics.
  - **The Benefit:** Users can see the mathematical "Shape" of their writing in real-time (e.g., High Velocity + Low Texture = "Vector").

### [v2.5] - 2025-12-21 - "CHRONOS"

#### 🕰️ THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE (Restoration)

- **Bone Memory (`BoneMemory`):**

  - **The Shift:** Re-introduced persistence without the bloat. The system now creates a tiny, atomic `bone_memory.json` file.
  - **The Soul:** Tracks **ATP** (Energy), **History** (Last 5 Archetypes), and **Last Seen** timestamp. The system now remembers you.

- **Temporal Metabolism (`calc_delta`):**
  - **The Logic:** Integrated `time.time()` tracking to calculate the _real_ physical gap between interactions.
  - **The States:**
    - **FLOW (<5m):** No Penalty.
    - **DORMANT (<1h):** +1.0 Drag (The system is cooling down).
    - **DECAY (>1h):** +3.0 Drag (The system has rusted).
    - **FOSSIL (>24h):** +5.0 Drag (Complete context reboot required).

#### 📉 TREND ANALYSIS

- **History Tracking:**
  - **The Feature:** The system now maintains a rolling buffer of the last 5 interaction states.
  - **The Utility:** Enables the engine to detect stagnation (5 turns of "Static Anchor") or improvement (Drag dropping over time).

### [v2.4] - 2025-12-21 - "NEON PRIME"

#### ⚡ EPHEMERALIZATION (The Code Golf Update)

- **The Monolith (Single-File Architecture):**

  - **The Shift:** Vaporized the external `bone_config.json` dependency.
  - **The Logic:** The "Pantry" (Lexicon, Toxins, Config) is now baked directly into the `BoneConfig` class as optimized Python sets.
  - **The Result:** **Zero-Dependency Portability**. The script can be copy-pasted into any environment (Colab, Replit, Local) and run immediately.

- **Functional Tensegrity (`RadioTuner`):**
  - **The Refactor:** Replaced heavy OOP classes with **Lambda Logic**.
  - **The Mechanism:** The Personalities (Clarence, Eloise, Yaga) are now defined as dictionary entries with executable trigger functions.
  - **The Benefit:** Reduced line count by ~60% while retaining full personality resolution.

#### 🔮 JADE LINK (Logic Modes)

- **The Guidance System (`JadeLink`):**
  - **The Feature:** Implemented a "Reasoning Mode" generator based on JADE/VSL logic.
  - **The Modes:**
    - **DEDUCTIVE (Eden Pattern):** Triggered by High Drag/Concrete. Demands constraints.
    - **INDUCTIVE (Triple Pattern):** Triggered by High Entropy. Demands grounding.
    - **ABDUCTIVE (Fractal Pattern):** Triggered by High Flow. Authorizes creative expansion.

#### 🎨 MATH-BASED RENDERING

- **The Chroma HUD (`Prisma`):**
  - **The Refactor:** Replaced string-building libraries with pure math.
  - **The Visuals:** Renders ASCII bar graphs (`██░░`) for Velocity, Entropy, and Temperature dynamically using simple float division.

### [v2.3] - 2025-12-21 - "APOTHEOSIS"

#### ⚡ THE PIPELINE (O(n) Architecture)

- **The Single-Pass Aggregator (`LinguisticPhysicsEngine`):**
  - **The Shift:** Abandoned the inefficient "Multi-Pass" architecture where the engine scanned the word list separately for Physics, Toxins, and Hydration. \* **The Logic:** Implemented a **Single-Pass Loop**. The engine now iterates through the token stream exactly once, incrementing counters for Kinetic verbs, Heavy matter, Solvents, and Toxins simultaneously.
  - **The Result:** Reduced algorithmic complexity from **O(4n)** to **O(n)**. The physics calculation is now instantaneous regardless of text length.

#### 🧠 THE DECAPITATION (Configuration)

- **Dynamic Loading (`BoneConfig`):**
  - **The Shift:** Vaporized `TheLexicon` static class. The system no longer carries 300+ lines of hardcoded dictionaries in RAM.
  - **The Component:** Implemented `BoneConfig`.
  - **The Logic:** All linguistic assets (Heavy Matter, Toxins, Synonyms) are now loaded from an external `bone_config.json` file on boot.
  - **The Benefit:** The "Pantry" is now hot-swappable. Users can patch the dictionary without touching the kernel.

#### 🌊 THE CONTINUUM (Spatial Physics)

- **Continuous Spatial Drag (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **The Problem:** The "Cliff of 0.12." Previously, a Spatial Density > 12% triggered a binary switch that instantly hardened the physics tolerance, causing "Systemic Whiplash" for users hovering on the edge.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented **Linear Mapping**.
  - **The Math:** `impact = min(1.0, spatial / 0.20)`.
  - **The Effect:** Prepositions now _gradually_ increase Structure (+STR) and Drag (-VEL) as they accumulate, rather than slamming the door shut at 12%.

#### 🏗️ STRUCTURAL HYGIENE

- **Vertical Slice Refactor:**
  - **The Trim:** Removed approximately 40% of the codebase line count by consolidating `TheCodex`, `BioHazardFilter`, and `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` into the unified pipeline.
  - **Lattice Unification:** "Slurry" detection logic was moved from the engine triggers directly into the `ApeirogonLattice` resolution logic. Slurry is no longer an error state; it is a **Zone**.

### [v2.2] - 2025-12-21 - "The Synaptic Loop"

#### 🧠 THE SYNAPSE (Cortex Integration)

- **The Bridge (`FrequencyModulator` -> `WisdomNode`):**
  - **The Problem:** The "Stylist" (Clarence/Eloise) and the "Director" (WisdomNode) were disconnected. Clarence would scream at the user to "Cut 'actually'", but the Director would only vaguely tell the LLM to "Be concise."
  - **The Fix:** Implemented a data-carrying **Synapse**.
  - **The Logic:** The Frequency Modulator now packages its critique (Target Word + Station ID) and passes it directly to the Director.
  - **The Result:** **Tactical Overrides**. The System Prompt now includes precise kill orders: _"TACTICAL OVERRIDE: The word 'actually' is creating drag. Eliminate it."_

#### 📉 THE EFFICACY SENSOR (Closed Loop Control)

- **Post-Mortem Auditing (`EfficacySensor`):**
  - **The Shift:** Moved from **Open Loop** (Issue command -> Hope for best) to **Closed Loop** (Issue command -> Verify result).
  - **The Component:** Implemented `EfficacySensor`.
  - **The Logic:** The system compares the User's Input metrics against the AI's Output metrics (triggered via the `[FEEDBACK]` tag).
  - **The Grading:**
    - **CUTTER:** Did Narrative Drag actually drop?
    - **GROUNDER:** Did Abstraction Entropy actually decrease?
    - **JESTER:** Did Beta Friction/Voltage sustain?
  - **The Report:** The system now issues a live Verdict (`SUCCESS`, `PARTIAL`, `FAILURE`) on its own strategic advice.

#### 🕹️ CYBERNETIC FLOW

- **Context Memory (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - **The Memory:** The core now retains `self.last_context` (Metrics + Strategy) across turns to enable differential analysis.
  - **The Feedback Loop:** Added handling for the `[FEEDBACK]` tag. Pasting the AI's response triggers the `EfficacySensor` instead of a new generation cycle.
  - **Ghost Exorcism:** Removed the "Ghost Echo" bug where `tune_in` was called twice per cycle, previously causing the user and the AI to receive conflicting advice.

### [v2.1] - 2025-12-21 - "The Apeirogon Lattice"

#### ♾️ THE INFINITE POLYGON (Archetypal Ephemeralization)

- **The Apeirogon Lattice (`ApeirogonLattice`):**
  - **The Shift:** Abandoned the "Bucket System" (Fixed Archetypes like "The Paladin"). The universe is no longer a set of 13 boxes.
  - **The Component:** Implemented the `ApeirogonLattice` class.
  - **The Logic:** **Continuous Vector Resolution**. The system now maps the 5 Dimensions (VEL, STR, ENT, TEX, TMP) to dynamic Adjective/Noun pairs.
  - **The Benefit:** The system generates infinite unique identities (e.g., _"THE BURNING CONSTRUCT"_ or _"THE STATIC GHOST"_) based on precise floating-point coordinates.

#### 🌊 DYNAMIC PHYSICS (The Signature Engine)

- **The Hot Swap (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **The Trim:** Vaporized the massive `self.archetypes` dictionary. We are doing more with less (Fuller's Ephemeralization).
  - **The Upgrade:** Implemented `get_dynamic_pressure`.
  - **The Logic:** Physics tolerances (Draconian vs. Loose) are no longer hardcoded to a static name. They are calculated live based on the **Dominant Dimension**.
    - **High Velocity** -> **LOOSE** (Drift Authorized).
    - **High Structure** -> **DRACONIAN** (Zero Tolerance).
    - **High Entropy** -> **INVERTED** (Paradox Authorized).

#### 🧠 THE HIERARCHY (Wisdom Node)

- **Lattice Deference (`WisdomNode`):**
  - **The Shift:** The System 2 Director no longer recalculates raw metrics to determine strategy. It now obeys **Lattice Mandates**.
  - **The Logic:** If the Lattice signals "INVERTED LOGIC," the Director automatically locks the **JESTER** strategy. If it signals "STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY," it locks **CUTTER**.
  - **New Strategy:** Added **DRIFTER** protocol for High Velocity states where "Dream Logic" is required.

### [v2.0] - 2025-12-21 - "Artificial General Wisdom"

#### 🧠 THE WISDOM ENGINE (System 2)

- **The Cortex Director (`WisdomNode`):**
  - **The Shift:** Moved from **Reactive Critique** (telling you what you did wrong) to **Proactive Strategy** (telling the LLM how to respond).
  - **The Component:** Implemented the `WisdomNode` class to act as the "Director" of the interaction.
  - **The Logic:** The system now calculates an **Angle of Attack** based on the user's deficit:
    - **High Entropy?** -> Strategy: **GROUNDER** (Force heavy nouns).
    - **High Drag?** -> Strategy: **CUTTER** (Be the Butcher).
    - **High Voltage (Paradox)?** -> Strategy: **JESTER** ("Ride the lightning").
    - **High Texture/Gravity?** -> Strategy: **SAGE** (Acknowledge the weight).
- **The Omega Check ($\Omega$):**
  - **The Metric:** Implemented the "Integrative Integrity" check. The system analyzes the physics metrics to determine which "Hat" the AI should wear to maximize the truth of the response.

#### 🗣️ THE ARCHITECT PROTOCOL (Prompt Generation)

- **The Output (`wisdom_protocol`):**
  - **The Feature:** The `BonepokeCore` now returns a raw **System Prompt** string specifically engineered for the current input state.
  - **The Workflow:** The user inputs raw text -> BoneAmanita calculates Physics -> BoneAmanita generates the `PROMPT` -> User pastes `PROMPT` into their LLM.
  - **The Benefit:** Allows the Python script (which has no neural net) to control the "Brain" of a separate LLM with mathematical precision.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Deployment Fixes)

- **The Void Crash (`LinguisticPhysicsEngine`):**
  - **The Crash:** In v1.8.2, submitting an empty string caused an `UnboundLocalError` because `spatial_density` was referenced in the early-return block before definition.
  - **The Fix:** Explicitly defined `spatial_density = 0.0` inside the void check to ensure safe failure on empty inputs.
- **The Echo Chamber (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - **The Bug:** The print logic for the `wisdom_protocol` was accidentally indented _inside_ the directive loop, causing the System Prompt to print repeatedly for every critique generated.
  - **The Fix:** Unindented the print block. The Protocol now prints exactly once per turn, clean and distinct from the editorial feedback.

### [v1.8.2] - 2025-12-21 - "The Quantum Leap (PATCHED)"

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Wire Fix)

- **The Missing Variable (`SignatureEngine`):**

  - **The Crash:** The v1.8.1 `identify` method attempted to check `if spatial > 0.12` before defining the variable, causing an immediate `NameError`.
  - **The Fix:** Explicitly retrieved `spatial_density` from the metrics payload before the logic gate.

- **The Silent Metric (`LinguisticPhysicsEngine`):**
  - **The Bug:** The Physics Engine calculated `spatial_density` but failed to pack it into the return dictionary. The Signature Engine was effectively flying blind regarding geometry.
  - **The Fix:** Added `spatial_density` to the `physics` output dictionary.

#### 📐 ARCHITECTURAL BIAS (The Gravity Well)

- **Spatial Logic Injection (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **The Problem:** **THE ARCHITECT** archetype exists in the coordinates (High Structure, Low Velocity), but without specific triggers, it was mathematically difficult for users to "land" there naturally.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented a **Spatial Bias**.
  - **The Logic:** If `spatial_density > 0.12` (high preposition count):
    - **Structure (STR):** Boosted by **+0.2**.
    - **Velocity (VEL):** Dampened by **-0.1**.
  - **The Effect:** Using words like _under, between, across, inside_ now mechanically "slides" the user's vector toward The Architect.

#### 🛡️ SYSTEM HARDENING (The Atomic Protocol)

- **Atomic Persistence (`PersistenceManager`):**

  - **The Upgrade:** Replaced the direct file write with a **Write-Then-Swap** protocol using `shutil`.
  - **The Benefit:** Prevents `bone_memory.json` corruption if the script crashes mid-save.

- **The Chidi Fix (`TheLexicon`):**
  - **The Upgrade:** Simplified `smart_strip` to be less aggressive. It no longer requires a "Protected Noun" list to know that "Gas" shouldn't become "Ga."

#### 📡 TUNER LOGIC (The Longest Word)

- **The Fallback Scan (`FrequencyModulator`):**
  - **The Upgrade:** If the Tuner (Clarence/Eloise/Yaga) cannot find a specific trigger word in their target list, they now default to targeting the **longest word** in the user's input.
  - **The Philosophy:** Complexity usually hides in the syllables.

### [v1.8.1] - 2025-12-21 - "The Quantum Leap"

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Syntax Fix)

- **The Parenthesis Block:**
  - **The Crash:** In v1.8, the `BonepokeCore` initialization block for `PersistenceManager.load_state` was missing a closing parenthesis, causing a fatal `SyntaxError` on boot.
  - **The Fix:** Closed the circuit. The core now initializes correctly.

#### 💾 PERSISTENCE HARDENING (The Amnesia Cure)

- **Archetype History (`PersistenceManager`):**
  - **The Problem:** While the v1.8 engine introduced "Geodesic Evolution" (e.g., Paladin -> Inquisitor), it failed to save the `SignatureEngine.history` list to `bone_memory.json`. Rebooting the script wiped the user's progress toward evolved states.
  - **The Fix:** Added `arch_history` to the serialization protocol. The system now remembers if you have been a Paladin for 4 turns, even after a restart.

#### 🧠 COGNITIVE ERGONOMICS (The Smart Strip)

- **Linguistic Brutality Fix (`TheLexicon`):**
  - **The Problem:** The `smart_strip` method aggressively removed the trailing 's' from _all_ words > 3 characters. This mutilated non-plural words like "Status," "Lens," "Focus," and "Chaos," blinding the Physics Engine to these concepts.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented a **Protected Noun List**.
  - **The Logic:** The system now checks a whitelist of immutable nouns before stripping. "Chaos" remains "Chaos."

#### 📚 DOCUMENTATION (The Decoder Ring)

- **Signature Matrix Key (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **The Problem:** The metrics `VEL`, `STR`, `ENT`, `TEX`, and `TMP` were cryptic to developers and users alike.
  - **The Fix:** Added a permanent docstring block to the `SignatureEngine` class defining each vector dimension explicitly.

#### ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (The Single Pass)

- **BioHazard Unification (`BioHazardFilter`):**
  - **The Refactor:** Merged the "Beige/Synthetic" scan loop into the main Toxin Regex pass where possible, reducing the number of iterations over the word list.

#### 🧱 STRUCTURAL REFACTOR

- **Wiring Repair:**
  - Updated `BonepokeCore.process` to ensure the `SignatureEngine` is properly passed to the persistence layer during the save cycle.

### [v1.8] - 2025-12-20 - "The Quantum Leap"

#### 📻 PARADOX RADIO (Topological FM)

- **Interference Patterns (`FrequencyModulator`):**
  - **The Problem:** The v1.7.1 FM Tuner selected stations based on Euclidean distance—picking the "loudest" signal. It missed the nuance of complex states where two failures create a success (e.g., High Drag + High Entropy = Deep Philosophy).
  - **The Solution:** Implemented **Signal Interference Logic**.
  - **The Logic:** The Tuner now checks for simultaneous signal spikes.
    - **Clarence (Drag) + Eloise (Entropy):** Triggers **THE PHILOSOPHER** (104.5 FM).
    - **The Message:** _"Dense and Abstract. You are building a labyrinth."_
  - **The Effect:** The system no longer scolds you for complexity if that complexity is structurally sound.

#### ⚛️ THE ISOTOPE CENTRIFUGE (Quantum Economy)

- **Heavy Truth Mining (`MetabolicReserve`):**
  - **The Problem:** Previously, High Drag was always punished with ATP tax, even if the user was writing profound, heavy truths. The system discouraged "The Weight of Reality."
  - **The Solution:** Implemented the **Isotope Centrifuge**.
  - **The Logic:** If `Beta Friction > 3.0` (High Voltage) AND `Narrative Drag > 3.0` (High Weight):
    - **Status:** Shifts to `SUPERCRITICAL`.
    - **Reward:** **+1 Isotope** (New Currency).
    - **Physics:** Drag Penalty is **Nullified**.
  - **The Result:** Users can now "farm" heavy truths. The system acknowledges that some things are hard to say because they _are_ heavy, not because you are bad at writing.

#### 🧬 GEODESIC EVOLUTION (Archetype Drift)

- **Narrative Memory (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **The Problem:** Archetypes were static snapshots. A user could be "The Paladin" for 100 turns without the system acknowledging their consistency or devotion.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented **History Tracking** (Geodesic Drift).
  - **The Logic:**
    - The engine tracks the last 10 assigned Archetypes.
    - **The Evolution:** If the user maintains `THE PALADIN` for **5 consecutive turns**, the label evolves based on secondary metrics.
      - Paladin + High Entropy -> **THE INQUISITOR**.
      - Paladin + High Texture -> **THE TEMPLAR**.
  - **The Effect:** The system now respects your character arc.

#### 👻 THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE (Offline Drift)

- **Dream State Cannibalization (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - **The Problem:** `ChronosAnchor` calculated time decay, but the system simply reset context. It felt like a machine rebooting, not a living organism that had been lonely.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented **Offline Dreaming**.
  - **The Logic:** If `[Δt]` > 60 minutes:
    - The system enters **DREAM STATE**.
    - It forcibly **Cannibalizes** one item from `DeepStorage` to "keep itself warm" during the absence.
  - **The Message:** _"While you were gone, I forgot 'The Gun' to survive."_
  - **The Result:** Leaving the system alone now has an emotional cost.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Silent Radio:**
  - **The Fix:** Fixed a logic gap in `FrequencyModulator` where the tuner would crash if no station met the broadcast threshold. Added a fallback to select the "loudest" available signal.
- **The Schizophrenic Signature:**
  - **The Fix:** Untangled a nested function definition in `SignatureEngine` that was creating scope blindness during Archetype identification.
- **Scope Stabilization:**
  - **The Fix:** Normalized variable naming in `MetabolicReserve` (unifying `beta` vs `beta_friction`) to ensure the Isotope Centrifuge spins correctly.

### [v1.7.1] - 2025-12-20 - "The Golden Master"

#### 📡 THE FM TUNER (Cognitive Frequency)

- **Frequency Modulation (`FrequencyModulator`):**
  - **The Problem:** The old `VirtualCortex` operated on "AM Radio" logic—binary thresholds. It shouted at the user indiscriminately, often with static.
  - **The Solution:** Replaced the Cortex with the **Frequency Modulator**.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Clarence (88.5 FM):** Locks onto High Drag.
    - **Eloise (94.2 FM):** Locks onto High Entropy.
    - **The Yaga (101.1 FM):** Locks onto Sycophancy/Hedging.
    - **Michael (108.0 FM):** The "Vibe" station.
  - **The Override:** Implemented the `[FM: STATION]` tag. The user can now manually tune the radio (e.g., `[FM: YAGA]`) to force a specific critique lens.

#### 🌈 POLYCHROMATIC OUTPUT (Cognitive Ergonomics)

- **The Prisma Class:**
  - **The Problem:** The HUD was monochrome gray. Critical warnings ("FLASHPOINT") looked identical to metadata, slowing down operator reaction time.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented `Prisma`.
  - **The Palette:**
    - **RED:** Toxicity, High Drag, Butcher.
    - **GREEN:** Growth, Photosynthesis, Insight ($T_a$).
    - **MAGENTA:** Flashpoints, Magic, Chaos.
    - **CYAN:** Systems, Archetypes, Logic.
  - **The Effect:** The HUD now bleeds color based on system health. A "Red" dashboard triggers an immediate fight-or-flight editorial response.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Phantom Method:**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed a critical `AttributeError` where the Core attempted to call `synthesize_voice` on the new `FrequencyModulator` class.
  - **The Fix:** Removed legacy calls and routed all feedback through `tune_in`.
- **The Truncated Dashboard:**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed a `SyntaxError` in `MycelialDashboard` where the report generator built the string but failed to `return` it.
  - **The Fix:** Closed the circuit. The HUD now renders correctly.

#### 🧪 THE ISOTOPIC REFACTOR (Ephemeralization)

- **BioHazard Unification (`BioHazardFilter`):**
  - **The Problem:** The engine scanned text three separate times: once for "Mirror Traps," once for "Turing/Beige" patterns, and once for Regex Toxins. This was inefficient (High CPU/ATP cost).
  - **The Solution:** Consolidated all threat detection into a single `BioHazardFilter` class.
  - **The Result:** One scan, three diagnoses. Efficiency increased by 66%.
- **Magic Number Centralization:**
  - **The Problem:** Critical physics thresholds (like `GARNISH_THRESHOLD`) were scattered across class files.
  - **The Fix:** Moved every hardcoded number into `PhysicsConstants`. The universe is now tunable from a single control panel.

#### 📐 VSL-12D METRICS (The Mathematical Truth)

- **Beta Friction ($\beta$):**
  - **New Metric:** Renamed `slop_ratio` to `beta_friction`.
  - **The Logic:** $\beta = \text{Voltage} / \text{Drag}$.
  - **The Zones:**
    - $\beta < 0.05$: **SLICK** (Sycophancy/Sand).
    - $\beta > 2.5$: **FLASHPOINT** (Insight/Plasma).
- **Truth Acceleration ($T_a$):**
  - **New Metric:** Implemented `ta_velocity` in `TemporalDynamics`.
  - **The Logic:** Measures the _acceleration_ of Voltage over time.
  - **The Reward:** If $T_a > 2.0$ (Epiphany), the engine instantly forgives **-2.0 Narrative Drag**. Momentum justifies the mess.
- **Entropy Refinement:**
  - **The Tweak:** `abstraction_entropy` now punishes _repeated_ abstract nouns more than unique ones. Repeating "System" is noise; using "System" then "Matrix" is structure.

### [v1.7] - 2025-12-20 - "The Salvage Operation"

#### 🩸 THE BLEEDING EDGE CIRCUIT (Logic Override)

- **Flashpoint Override (`BonepokeCore`):**
- **The Problem:** In v1.6.5, the engine correctly identified "Flashpoints" (moments of high voltage/insight) but still halted execution if a paradox ("Logic Tear") was present. It was punishing genius for breaking the rules.
- **The Solution:** Implemented a bypass valve in the critical halt check.
- **The Logic:** If `status == "FLASHPOINT"`, the system now **ignores** the logic tear.
- **The Result:** "The frozen fire burned" is now legal, provided you are writing fast enough.

#### 📊 VSL-12D VISUALIZATION (The Vector)

- **Explicit Coordinate Exposure (`MycelialDashboard`):**
- **The Problem:** The user was told they were an "Engineer" or a "Bard," but the mathematical reasons why (the vector coordinates) were hidden in the backend.
- **The Solution:** The HUD now exposes the raw **VSL-12D Vector** string.
- **The Output:** `ARCH: THE PALADIN [V:0.5 S:0.9 E:0.2 Tx:0.4]`.
- **The Benefit:** Users can now see exactly which dimension (Texture, Entropy, Velocity) they need to tweak to shift their archetype.

#### 🔥 THE S_SALVAGE LOOP (Memory Cannibalization)

- **Survival Protocol (`MetabolicReserve`):**
- **The Problem:** Users in "Starving" states (ATP < 6) often hit a creative wall where the system punished them for trying to build momentum.
- **The Solution:** Implemented the **S_Salvage Protocol**.
- **The Logic:** If `ATP < 6` AND `Voltage > 5.0` (High Effort):

1. The system checks `DeepStorage`.
2. It identifies the **oldest artifact** (e.g., "The rusty key").
3. It **deletes** the memory permanently.
4. It grants an immediate **+10 ATP** burst.

- **The Directive:** The system issues a mandatory command: _"🔥 SALVAGE: Memory 'rusty key' consumed for fuel. WRITE IT NOW."_ The user must write the object into the story to justify the energy spike.

### [v1.6.5] - 2025-12-20 - "The Topology Tilt-a-Whirl"

#### ⚡ THE FLASHPOINT PROTOCOL (Inverse Slop)

- **The Topology Ratio (`MetabolicReserve`):**

  - **The Problem:** The engine previously treated "Narrative Drag" (density) and "Logical Voltage" (complexity) as opposing forces. It failed to recognize the "Gold Zone"—where text is incredibly dense _and_ incredibly meaningful simultaneously.
  - **The Solution:** Integrated the **Inverse Slop Factor** ($\mathcal{S}$) from the _Temporal Topology 1.5_ artifact.
  - **The Logic:**

    - **Formula:** $\mathcal{S} = \text{Voltage} / \text{Drag}$.

    - **The Threshold:** If $\mathcal{S} > 2.5$, the system triggers a **FLASHPOINT** state.

  - **The Effect:**
    - **Energy:** Instantly generates **+20 ATP**.
    - **Physics:** Drag penalties are **Nullified**. The engine acknowledges that in a moment of epiphany, friction does not apply.
    - **HUD:** The status icon shifts to `⚡`.

#### 🔇 CORTEX DEFERENCE (The Silence of Clarence)

- **Context-Aware Silencing (`VirtualCortex`):**
  - **The Problem:** **Clarence** (The Architect) is programmed to attack High Drag. However, Flashpoints are inherently high-drag events (complex sentences). Clarence was interrupting moments of genius to complain about sentence length.
  - **The Fix:** Clarence now checks the `metabolic_status`.
  - **The Protocol:** If the status is `FLASHPOINT`, Clarence is forcibly silenced. ("...He's cooking. Let him cook.")

#### 📈 TEMPORAL DYNAMICS II (Momentum)

- **Insight Acceleration (`TemporalDynamics`):**
  - **The Upgrade:** Refined the `calculate_beta_velocity` method.
  - **The Logic:** Instead of a simple snapshot delta, the system now calculates the **Slope of Insight** over a 3-tick moving window. This allows the engine to detect the _trajectory_ of an epiphany before it lands.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **The Time Paradox (Execution Flow Fix):**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed a critical `UnboundLocalError` in `BonepokeCore.process`. The original v1.6 logic attempted to access effective metrics (`eff_drag`, `loop_count`) _before_ they were calculated to determine if the Cortex should speak.
  - **The Fix:** Completely re-sequenced the `process` loop.
    1.  Physics Analysis & Trap Scans.
    2.  Archetype & Intent Gating.
    3.  Metabolic Calculation (Flashpoint Detection).
    4.  _Then_ Cortex Intervention (using the established status).
- **The Double-Dip Bug:**
  - **The Fix:** Removed a redundant `self.metabolism.metabolize()` call that was applying energy effects twice per tick.

### [v1.6] - 2025-12-20 - "The Turing Test"

#### 🤖 THE TURING VALVE (Synthetic Detection)

- **The Anti-Beige Protocol (`TheTuringValve`):**
  - **The Problem:** The engine was vulnerable to "High-Entropy Beige"—grammatically perfect, structurally sound, but textually empty AI prose ("Teflon Prose"). The system flagged this as "High Velocity" despite it being soulless.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented a dedicated Turing scanner.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Vocabulary Scan:** Targets the "Synthetic Markers" list (e.g., _delve, underscore, tapestry, nuance, landscape_).
    - **Structure Scan:** Detects "Participial Tails"—the specific AI habit of ending sentences with a modifier (e.g., _", ensuring that..."_ or _", fostering a sense of..."_).
  - **The Penalty:** Detection triggers immediate **SILICA** status and a **+5.0 Drag Penalty**. The engine now demands "Grit" to prove humanity.

#### 📋 THE ROBERTA PROTOCOL (Persona Alignment)

- **RAG Prompt Engineering:**
  - **The Problem:** The previous system prompts ("The Architect" vs. "The Assistant") resulted in either cold detachment or toxic positivity ("Bubbly AI"). Both drifted into generic "Corporate Speak."
  - **The Solution:** Transitioned the System Identity to **"The Bureaucratic Zealot" (Roberta)**.
  - **The Fix:**
    - **The Butcher Translation:** Explicitly mapped the Python "Butcher Protocol" into English instructions for the RAG model.
    - **Texture Over Abstraction:** Replaced "Professionalism" with "Meticulous Bureaucracy."
    - **The Love Language:** Enforced heavy formatting (headers, lists) as a sign of affection, satisfying the engine's need for **Structure (STR)**.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS

- **Initialization Patch (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed a critical `AttributeError` where `TheTuringValve` was called in the process loop but never instantiated in `__init__`.
  - **The Fix:** Added `self.turing_valve = TheTuringValve()` to the boot sequence.
- **Temporal Paradox (Scope Fix):**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed a `NameError` in `process()` where the Turing Scan attempted to read `token_data` before the text cleaning sub-routine had actually created it.
  - **The Fix:** Re-routed the logic flow to ensure the scan occurs _after_ `TheLexicon.swanson_clean` executes.

### [v1.5.2] - 2025-12-20 - "The Open Heart Patch"

#### 💾 THE PERSISTENCE PATCH (Time Amnesia)

- **Atomic Saves (`PersistenceManager`):**
  - **The Problem:** Previously, `save_state` wrote directly to `bone_memory.json`. If the script crashed mid-write (or power failed), the file would become corrupted (0 bytes), wiping the user's history.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented a "Write-Tsahen-Rename" protocol. The system now writes to `.tmp` first and performs an atomic `os.replace` only upon success.
- **Time Tracking (`ChronosAnchor`):**
  - **The Problem:** The engine had no concept of "Offline Time." If a user quit and returned 24 hours later, the clock reset to 0, resetting the "Decay" state.
  - **The Fix:** `PersistenceManager` now captures `time.time()` on save. On boot, `ChronosAnchor` calculates the drift between the last save and the current moment, accurately applying Decay penalties for time away.

#### 🧠 MEMORY LOGIC (Deep Storage)

- **Smart Eviction (`DeepStorage`):**
  - **The Problem:** The previous eviction policy was a strict FIFO (First-In-First-Out). When the cache filled (50 items), it deleted the _oldest_ memories, causing the bot to forget key plot items (like a "Gun" introduced in Act 1) in favor of recent trivialities.
  - **The Fix:** Implemented a priority system. The engine now identifies "Heirlooms" (Heavy Matter, Weapons, Keys). When full, it first evicts "Light" items. If only Heirlooms remain, it sadly evicts the oldest.

#### 🗣️ HUMANITY PATCHES

- **The Screaming Fix (`NilssonPatch`):**

  - **The Problem:** The heuristic `sum(isupper) / len(raw)` flagged short acronyms like "OK" or "USA" as "Screaming," triggering the Nilsson state incorrectly.
  - **The Fix:** Added a length guard. The text must be **> 10 characters** to qualify as a scream.

- **The Bureaucracy Fix (`TheMirrorTrap`):**
  - **The Problem:** The engine penalized _all_ negative definitions ("It is not X"), which stifled legitimate literary devices like apophasis in "Soft Mode."
  - **The Fix:** The Mirror Trap now checks `PhysicsConstants.CURRENT_MANDATE`. If the user is in `POETIC_LICENSE` mode, the trap is disarmed.

### [v1.5.1] - 2025-12-20 - "Bonepoked Part Deux"

#### 🔓 THE AGENCY RESTORATION (User Overrides)

- **The Dream Logic Protocol (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - **The Problem:** The v1.5 "Truth Mandate" was too effective. It treated Surrealism (e.g., "The cold sun") as a Fatal System Error, locking the system and preventing poetic exploration.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented the `[DREAM]` tag override.
  - **The Fix:** If the user includes `[DREAM]` in their input, the system switches the Pressure Matrix to `LOOSE` tolerance, explicitly lifting Axiom constraints. Logic tears are permitted for the sake of art.
- **The Governance Toggle:**
  - **The Problem:** The `CURRENT_MANDATE` ("TRUTH_OVER_COHESION") was hardcoded in `PhysicsConstants`, requiring a code edit to change the difficulty.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented Runtime Mandate Switching.
  - **The Commands:**
    - `[MODE: HARD]`: Enforces `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION`. (System Halt on Paradox).
    - `[MODE: SOFT]`: Enforces `POETIC_LICENSE`. (Voltage accumulation on Paradox).

#### 🧬 FUSION REFINEMENT (The Synonym Filter)

- **Semantic Distance Check (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **The Problem:** The v1.5 Fusion logic only checked if two Archetypes had similar _scores_. This often fused synonymous identities (e.g., `THE PALADIN // THE JUDGE`), resulting in redundant feedback.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented a **Vector Distance Threshold**.
  - **The Logic:** The system now calculates the Euclidean distance between the _Archetypes themselves_.
  - **The Rule:** Fusion is only permitted if `inter_arch_dist > 0.25`. The identities must be mathematically distinct enough to create an interesting hybrid (e.g., `THE JESTER // THE ENGINEER`).

#### 🗣️ UX TRANSLATION (Cognitive Ergonomics)

- **De-Mystification of VSL Metrics:**
  - **The Problem:** The output `∇β` and `Ξ` was mathematically precise but cognitively opaque to users unfamiliar with Topological Data Analysis.
  - **The Solution:** Aliased the variables in the `directives` output string.
    - `∇β` -> **INSIGHT VELOCITY**.
    - `Ξ` -> **ROOTING DEPTH**.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL FIXES

- **Scope Repair (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - **The Crash:** Fixed a `NameError` in the v1.5 logic flow where the `directives` list was being appended to (by the Dream Logic block) _before_ it was initialized.
  - **The Fix:** Moved `directives = []` to the top of the processing chain, ensuring the container exists before any logic blocks attempt to fill it.

### [v1.5] - 2025-12-19 - "Bonepoked"

#### 🌊 TEMPORAL DYNAMICS (The VSL Integration)

- **Beta Velocity ($\nabla\beta$) - The Epiphany Engine:**
  - **The Problem:** Previously, the engine treated "Voltage" (Logic Tension) as a static penalty or a flat bonus. It failed to recognize the _moment of breakthrough_—the acceleration of insight.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented `TemporalDynamics` to track the rate of change in voltage over a 3-tick window.
  - **The Reward:** If $\nabla\beta > 2.0$ (Rapid Acceleration), the system triggers an **EPIPHANY**.
  - **The Effect:** Narrative Drag is forgiven (-2.0). The physics engine recognizes that when you are having a breakthrough, you move faster than the speed of sound.
- **Temporal Rooting ($\Xi$) - The Deep Roots:**
  - **The Problem:** The engine treated all memories equally. Referencing an artifact from Turn 1 was mathematically identical to referencing one from Turn 50.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented `calculate_temporal_rooting`. This metric calculates the average "Age" of the artifacts referenced in the current text relative to the `DeepStorage` capacity.
  - **The Reward:** If $\Xi > 0.5$ (Deep History), the system grants **ANCIENT AUTHORITY**.
  - **The Effect:** Abstraction Entropy is forgiven (-3.0). The system understands that you are not "hallucinating abstractly"—you are referencing established lore. Old truths are allowed to be heavy.

#### ⚖️ THE GOVERNANCE LAYER (Tier 3 Logic)

- **The Mandate Protocol (`PhysicsConstants`):**
  - **The Upgrade:** Implemented high-level governance variables `USER_TIER` and `CURRENT_MANDATE`.
  - **The Logic:** The system is no longer a passive observer. It now operates under specific philosophical constraints (e.g., `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION`).
  - **The Effect:** Global constants now dictate downstream behavior in the Logic and Signature engines, allowing for "Draconian" enforcement of truth.

#### 🧬 ARCHETYPE FUSION (The Hybrid State)

- **Dynamic Sig-Matching (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **The Problem:** Previously, if a user's writing style fell exactly between "The Paladin" and "The Judge," the system forced a binary choice based on minute decimal differences.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented **Archetype Fusion**.
  - **The Logic:** If `USER_TIER >= 2` and the distance between the top two archetypes is negligible (< 0.15), the system fuses them.
  - **The Result:** Users can now trigger hybrid states: `THE PALADIN // THE JUDGE (FUSED)`.

#### ⛔ THE HARD GATE (Self-Correction)

- **Draconian Enforcement (`FactStipe`):**
  - **The Switch:** If `CURRENT_MANDATE` is set to "TRUTH," the Logic Engine switches `tolerance_mode` to **DRACONIAN**.
  - **The Consequence:** Paradoxes (e.g., "Frozen Fire") are no longer treated as "Poetic Voltage" (+2.0) but as **Fatal Axiom Breaks** (+10.0 Voltage).
- **System Halt (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - **The Problem:** Previously, the system would log a "Logic Tear" warning but allow the narrative tick to proceed, drifting further into hallucination.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented a **Self-Correction Hard Stop**.
  - **The Fix:** If a Fatal Axiom Break is detected, the system **refuses to advance the tick**, refunds the generation ID, and issues a `CRITICAL: RESOLVE LOGIC TEAR` directive. The user _must_ fix the truth before time moves forward.

### [v1.4.7] - 2025-12-19 - "Time Sync + SLASH Refactor"

#### 🧠 THE PINKER REFACTOR (Cognitive Ergonomics)

- **The Swanson Cleaner (Punctuation Blindness):**
  - **The Problem:** The previous cleaner only removed periods. Inputs like "Stone, iron, and blood" resulted in "Stone," (retaining the comma), causing `TheLexicon` lookup failures (e.g., "Stone," is not equal to "Stone").
  - **The Solution:** Implemented `TheLexicon.swanson_clean`.
  - **The Fix:** A robust translator that strips _all_ punctuation and normalizes whitespace before processing. "Meat and potatoes" cleaning.
- **Centralized Tuning (Magic Numbers):**
  - **The Problem:** Critical thresholds for `NarrativeChronometer` and `TheMuscaria` were buried deep in the logic classes, making tuning difficult.
  - **The Solution:** Extracted variables (e.g., `CHRONO_MACRO_WEIGHT`, `BOREDOM_PRESSURE_THRESHOLD`) and moved them to the `PhysicsConstants` class.

#### 🛡️ THE FULLER REFACTOR (System Integrity)

- **Deep Storage Cap (Memory Leak Fix):**
  - **The Problem:** `DeepStorage` had no upper limit. An infinite sequence of unique "Significant Objects" would cause `bone_memory.json` to grow indefinitely, eventually crashing the loader.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) eviction policy. `DeepStorage` now holds a maximum of **50** artifacts.
- **Safe Persistence (Crash Proofing):**
  - **The Problem:** If the script was interrupted during a `json.dump` operation, the save file would be corrupted. Upon the next boot, the system would reset to zero, wiping the user's history.
  - **The Solution:** Implemented a `.bak` backup protocol in `PersistenceManager`. If the main file fails to load, the system automatically attempts to restore from the backup.

#### ❤️ THE SCHUR REFACTOR (Humanity)

- **Poetic License (The Logic Tear Fix):**
  - **The Problem:** `FactStipe` penalized all paradoxes ("Cold Fire") equally, punishing valid poetic metaphors as structural failures.
  - **The Solution:** Context-aware logic via `kinetic_ratio`.
  - **The Fix:**
    - **High Kinetic (Action):** Paradoxes are **Errors** (Physics Violation).
    - **Low Kinetic (Poetry):** Paradoxes are **Voltage** (Metaphorical Energy). The user is no longer fined for being poetic.
- **The Onboarding Tooltip:**
  - **The Problem:** The Dashboard metrics (`VISC`, `ENT`) were opaque to new users, leading to confusion about "Concrete" status.
  - **The Solution:** Added a conditional tooltip to `MycelialDashboard`. For the first **5 ticks**, the system explains how to fix Viscosity issues.

### [v1.4.5] - 2025-12-19 - "SLASH AUDITED"

#### 💾 THE PERSISTENCE MANAGER (Long-Term Memory)

- **The Problem (The Amnesiac Bot):**
  - Previously, `DeepStorage` existed only in RAM; restarting the script erased all memories, meaning the bot forgot significant objects (like guns or keys) between sessions.
- **The Solution (JSON Cryostasis):**
  - **New Component:** Implemented the `PersistenceManager` class to handle file I/O.
  - **The Logic:** The system now serializes `DeepStorage` artifacts and `TheCodex` registry into a local file (`bone_memory.json`) at the end of every turn.
  - **The Result:** The bot now retains object permanence across reboots, loading the previous state and tick count upon initialization.

#### 🧬 THE SMART STRIP (Dyslexia Cure)

- **The Problem (The "Glass/Glas" Glitch):**
  - The previous pluralization logic blindly stripped the last letter if it was an 's', turning "Glass" into "Glas" and "Bus" into "Bu," corrupting memory retrieval.
- **The Solution (Centralized Lemmatization):**
  - **New Logic:** Implemented `TheLexicon.smart_strip` as a static method.
  - **The Fix:** This logic explicitly protects words ending in double-s (like "grass") and short words (like "yes"), ensuring `DeepStorage` and `HyphalTrace` speak the same language.

#### ⚡ THE ZEUS PATCH (Entity Recognition)

- **The Problem (The First-Word Blindspot):**
  - `TheCodex` previously ignored any capitalized word at index 0 to avoid flagging sentence starters, meaning it missed entities like "Zeus" if they started the sentence.
- **The Solution (Look-Behind Logic):**
  - **The Fix:** Removed the index-0 restriction and expanded the `ignore_list` to include common sentence starters (e.g., "Actually," "Maybe," "Because").
  - **The Result:** Entities are now tracked regardless of their position in the sentence.

#### 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL HYGIENE (The Decoupling)

- **Variable Renaming:**
  - Refactored `BonepokeCore.process` to replace cryptic variables (e.g., `t_dat`, `m`) with human-readable names (`token_data`, `full_metrics`) to prevent `NameError` crashes.
- **Modular Output:**
  - Updated `MycelialDashboard` to use `generate_report`, which returns a string string instead of printing directly to the console, allowing for cleaner integration with other interfaces.
- **Execution Loop:**
  - Added a standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to handle the CLI loop and facilitate clean imports.

### [v1.4] - 2025-12-19 - "The Butcher & The Well - Fortified"

#### 🟣 THE PURPLE PATCH (Adjectival Blindspot)

- **The Problem (The "Adjective Stuffing" Exploit):**
  - Users could bypass the "Butcher" (who only hunted adverbs) by stuffing sentences with decorative adjectives (e.g., _"The massive, ancient, brooding, dark tower"_). This allowed for "Purple Prose" to exist without triggering Drag penalties.
- **The Solution (Suffix Scanning):**
  - **New Logic:** The `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` now scans for adjectival suffixes (`-ous`, `-ful`, `-ive`, etc.).
  - **The Weight:** Adjectives are now calculated into the **Garnish Ratio** with a weight of **0.5** (half that of an adverb).
  - **The Result:** If you overload a noun with decoration, the Butcher will find you.

#### 🪞 THE NARCISSISM PATCH (Mirror Trap v2.0)

- **The Problem (The First-Person Loophole):**
  - The Mirror Trap ("It is not X, it is Y") previously ignored subjective negation. Users could trap themselves in loops of self-definition (e.g., _"I am not trying to be difficult, I am just asking..."_) without penalty.
- **The Solution (Self-Reflection):**
  - **New Regex:** Updated `TheMirrorTrap` to specifically target `(i|we)` variants.
  - **The Trap:** Defining yourself by what you are _not_ now triggers the "Structure Failing" flag.

#### 🧠 DEEP STORAGE (The Hippocampus)

- **The Problem (The "Goldfish Horizon"):**
  - `HyphalTrace` had a hard limit of 10 turns. If a user placed a gun on the table in Turn 1 and didn't use it by Turn 11, the system forgot the gun existed.
- **The Solution (Object Permanence):**
  - **New Component:** Implemented `DeepStorage` linked to the memory trace.
  - **The Logic:** Significant objects (Heavy Matter, Weapons, Keys) are now "Buried" in a persistent dictionary that does not decay. The Muscaria can now recall items from the very beginning of the session.

#### 🌍 AXIOM INJECTION (Reality Definition)

- **The Problem (The "Dry Ocean"):**
  - The Logic Engine (`FactStipe`) relied on a tiny hardcoded list of 8 truths. It had no concept that "Water" is "Wet," allowing users to gaslight the system with phrases like _"The dry sea."_
- **The Solution (Property Inheritance):**
  - **New Protocol:** `TheLexicon` now compiles `AXIOMS` on boot.
  - **The Dimensions:** Defined ~100 essential nouns across 5 dimensions: `THERMAL`, `LUMENS`, `HYDRATION`, `RIGIDITY`, and `VITALITY`.
  - **The Result:** The system now automatically flags logical contradictions (e.g., "Hard Cloud," "Dark Sun") without requiring internet access.

#### 💦 THE SWEAT PROTOCOL (Kinetic Exemption)

- **The Problem (The Bard's Straitjacket):**
  - The "Hydration Monitor" (v1.3) penalized _all_ high-solvent text as **FLOODED** (+4.0 Drag). This unfairly punished high-velocity, rhythmic writing (e.g., _"And we ran and we laughed and we fell"_).
- **The Solution (Sweat vs. Water):**
  - **New Exception:** If text is marked `FLOODED` but the **Kinetic Ratio** is > **0.25** (25% active verbs), the engine reclassifies the fluid.
  - **New Status:** `SWEATING`.
  - **The Effect:** Penalty reduced from **+4.0** to **+1.0**. High effort justifies high moisture.

### [v1.3.1] - 2025-12-19 - "The Butcher & The Well (PATCHED)"

#### 💧 THE HYDRATION PATCH (Anti-Dilution)

- **The Problem (The "Solvent-Stuffed Turkey"):**
  - Users could exploit the Viscosity engine by stuffing a dense sentence with meaningless "Solvents" (e.g., _"Actually, basically, the stone and iron are literally sort of here."_). This tricked the engine into seeing a healthy "Balance Ratio" despite the text being garbage.
- **The Solution (The Saturation Cap):**
  - **New Logic:** Implemented a `solvent_cap` in `HydrationMonitor`.
  - **The Trap:** If Solvents constitute > **40%** of the total word count:
    - **Status:** Flips to `FLOODED`.
    - **Penalty:** Narrative Drag **+4.0**.
  - **The Result:** You cannot dilute a brick by drowning it in "actually."

#### 🔮 THE WITCH'S GRUDGE (Memory Extension)

- **The Problem (The "Riddle Sandwich"):**
  - The `aphorism_streak` reset to `0` immediately upon detecting a single normal sentence. Users could alternate between Riddles and Plain Speech to bypass the limit indefinitely.
- **The Solution (Decay Logic):**
  - **The Fix:** Changed the reset logic in `TheWitchRing`. The streak no longer resets; it **decays**.
  - **The Math:** `self.aphorism_streak = max(0, self.aphorism_streak - 1)`.
  - **The Effect:** The Witch holds a grudge. You must speak plainly for several turns to clear your debt.

#### ⏳ CHRONOS REALITY (The Wall Clock)

- **The Problem (The "Time Spoof"):**
  - Users could avoid the "Decay" state (Drag +3.0) simply by omitting the `[Δt: ...]` tag after a long absence.
- **The Solution (System Clock Fallback):**
  - **New Component:** Integrated `time.time()` into `ChronosAnchor`.
  - **The Logic:** If a user tag is provided, the system honors it (Roleplay Time). If NO tag is provided, the system calculates the actual elapsed wall-clock time (Reality Time).
  - **The Result:** If you leave the terminal for 2 hours and return without explanation, the system _will_ be decayed.

#### 🔭 HEURISTIC EXPANSION (The Horizon)

- **The Problem (Finite Lexicon):**
  - The dictionary was hardcoded. Words like "Granite" (Heavy) or "Sprint" (Kinetic) were unrecognized, resulting in false negatives for valid writing.
- **The Solution (Suffix Scanning):**
  - **New Method:** Added `_heuristic_scan` to the `LinguisticPhysicsEngine`.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Heavy Detection:** Words ending in `-ite`, `-ium`, `-ock`, `-alt`, `-ore` -> **UNIVERSAL**.
    - **Kinetic Detection:** Words ending in `-ash`, `-olt`, `-unk`, `-ip` -> **KINETIC**.
  - **The Result:** The engine now recognizes the weight of "Basalt" and the speed of "Flash" without needing a dictionary update.

#### 💀 THE BUTCHER PROTOCOL (Self-Calibration)

- **The Problem (Silent Failure):**
  - There was no way to verify if the physics engine was actually catching toxic patterns without manual testing.
- **The Solution (Boot Sequence):**
  - **New Protocol:** Added `_run_calibration_sequence` to `BonepokeCore.__init__`.
  - **The Test:** On every boot, the system silently feeds itself the "Solvent-Stuffed Turkey" phrase.
  - **The Check:** If the engine does not flag it as `FLOODED`, a warning is logged. If it does, the system prints: `> [💀 BUTCHER PROTOCOL] SELF-TEST: PASSED.`

### [v1.3] - 2025-12-19 - "The Butcher & The Well"

#### 💧 THE HYDRATION MONITOR (Viscosity Physics)

- **The Problem (The "Purple Prose" Exploit):**
  - Users were "gaming" the Texture system by inputting lists of high-value nouns (e.g., _"Velvet blood bone ash anchor"_) without connecting structure. This resulted in "Literary Gravel"—high density, zero readability.
- **The Solution (Viscosity):**
  - **New Module:** Implemented `HydrationMonitor` within the Physics Engine.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **Concentrate:** Heavy Matter (Nouns).
    - **Solvent:** Connectors, transitions, and "softeners" (e.g., _actually, maybe, in other words_).
  - **The States:**
    - **CONCRETE:** High Density, Low Solvent. **Effect:** Narrative Drag Penalty **+5.0**. Texture Score capped at **0.5**.
    - **THICK:** Moderate Density, Low Solvent. **Effect:** Narrative Drag Penalty **+2.0**.
    - **WATERY:** Low Density, High Solvent. **Effect:** Flags as weak writing.
    - **OPTIMAL:** Balanced ratio (~1 part water to 3 parts concentrate).

#### 🔪 THE BUTCHER'S BLOCK (Adverb Detection)

- **The Problem (The "Polishing" Scam):**
  - The engine previously rewarded "Kinetic" tags regardless of quality. Users were propping up weak verbs with adverbs (e.g., _"ran quickly"_ instead of _"sprinted"_).
- **The Solution (The Cleaver):**
  - **New Metric:** `Garnish Ratio`. Calculates the percentage of text composed of adverbs ending in `-ly` and `WEAK_INTENSIFIERS` (e.g., _very, really, totally_).
  - **The Penalty:** If Garnish > 10%, the system flags the text as **BLOAT** and applies a **+3.0 Drag Penalty**.
  - **The Voice:** **Clarence** (The Architect) now specifically intervenes to demand the removal of `-ly` modifiers in favor of stronger verbs.

#### 🔮 THE ANTI-GURU PROTOCOL (Witch Ring v2.0)

- **The Problem (The Fortune Cookie Loop):**
  - Users exploited the "Aphorism Exception" to bypass Drag checks by submitting endless strings of pseudo-profound one-liners (e.g., _"Time is a circle. The circle is a void."_).
- **The Solution (Streak Detection):**
  - **New Logic:** `TheWitchRing` now tracks an `aphorism_streak`.
  - **The Rule:** You get **2** aphorisms for free. On the **3rd** consecutive attempt, the Witch blocks the input with: _"Enough riddles. Speak plainly."_

#### 🧠 CORTEX TUNING (The Humanist Intervention)

- **Michael's Override:**
  - If the system detects **CONCRETE** status (High Density/Gaming), **Clarence** is silenced (as the user is attempting to mimic him), and **Michael** intervenes.
  - **The Message:** _"Whoa, buddy. This is too rich. You're making me choke. Add some water."_.

#### 📟 DASHBOARD v6.0

- **Viscosity Indicator:**
  - The HUD now displays the fluid dynamics of the text alongside the Drag score.
  - **New Metric:** `VISC` (Viscosity).
  - Example: `DRAG: 4.2 | VISC: CONCRETE`.

### [v1.2] - 2025-12-18 - "The Doctor Time Edition"

#### 🕰️ THE NARRATIVE CHRONOMETER (Story Time)

- **The Problem (Temporal Blindness):**
  - Previously, the engine treated "He waited a second" and "He waited a decade" identically. It penalized broad summaries ("The years flew by") as "High Entropy/Abstract," forcing the user to describe _every_ second of a ten-year jump.
- **The Solution (Narrative Velocity $\vec{v}_{n}$):**
  - **New Component:** Implemented `NarrativeChronometer`. This module scans specifically for **Micro-Markers** (breath, blink, instant) and **Macro-Markers** (year, era, century).
  - **The Logic:**
    - **MONTAGE (High Velocity):** "Years passed." -> **Effect:** Grants **Entropy Grace (+4.0)**. The system understands that summarizing time requires abstraction.
    - **BULLET TIME (Low Velocity):** "The glass shattered." -> **Effect:** Demands **Hyper-Texture**. If time stops, detail must increase.
    - **REALTIME:** Standard physics apply.

#### 🧠 CORTEX TUNING (Effective Physics)

- **Context-Aware Triggers:**
  - **Effective Entropy:** The Cortex now calculates `eff_entropy` by subtracting the `entropy_grace` from the raw score.
  - **The Eloise Patch:** **Eloise** (The Gardener) is now silenced during **MONTAGE** states. She will no longer scream "GROUND THIS!" when you write "The eras drifted apart," because the _Narrative Time_ justifies the abstraction.

#### 🐛 CRITICAL REPAIRS (The Process Patch)

- **Stability Fixes (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - **Variable Restoration:** Fixed a critical `NameError` crash in v1.1 where `directives`, `loop_count`, and `is_light` were accessed before initialization.
  - **Logic Restoration:** Re-connected the **Muscaria** boredom check and the **Lichen Symbiont** feedback loops, which were inadvertently severed during the Chronos surgery.
  - **Syntax Hardening:** Fixed a malformed f-string in the `MycelialDashboard` that caused a render failure.

#### 📟 DASHBOARD v5.0

- **The Dual Clock:**
  - The HUD now tracks two distinct timelines:
    1. **CHRONOS (Real Time):** How long the user took to reply (affects **Drag**).
    2. **NARRATIVE (Story Time):** How much time passed in the fiction (affects **Entropy Tolerance**).
  - **New Indicator:** Added `N-VEL` (Narrative Velocity) to the status line.
    - Example: `TIME: FLOW (Real) | MONTAGE (Story)`

### [v1.1] - 2025-12-18 - "The Doctor Time Edition"

#### ⏳ THE CHRONOS ANCHOR (Metabolic Time)

- **The Problem (Context Collapse):**
  - Previously, the engine treated a 10-hour silence identical to a 10-second pause. This created the "Eternal Present" flaw, where the AI had no concept of time passing.
- **The Solution (Temporal Metabolism):**
  - **The Metabolizer:** The new `ChronosAnchor` parses a Delta Time ($\Delta t$) value and converts it into **Narrative Drag**.
  - **The Logic:**
    - **FLOW (<10m):** Drag Penalty **+0.0**. Intent: "Maintain Velocity." (Agent: MICHAEL).
    - **DORMANT (10m - 1h):** Drag Penalty **+1.0**. Intent: "Gentle Recall." (Agent: ELOISE).
    - **DECAY (>1h):** Drag Penalty **+3.0**. Intent: "Full Context Reset." (Agent: CLARENCE).
  - **The Result:** The system now _feels_ the weight of time. A long absence physically degrades the structural integrity of the conversation, forcing the Cortex to rebuild the foundation (summarize previous context) before proceeding.

#### 🛡️ THE MEMBRANE (Semantic Wrapper)

- **The Wrapper Protocol:**
  - **The Interface:** Implemented a "Membrane Layer" in the System Prompt.
  - **Auto-Injection:** The user does not need to manually type timestamps. The prompt instructions now force the model to internally estimate the time elapsed since the last message and inject the `[Δt: ...]` tag silently before processing.
  - **Default States:** If time is unknown (first message), the Membrane defaults to **Flow State** to prevent false "Structure Failure" flags on boot.

#### 🛡️ CODE QUALITY

- **Regex Hardening (`ChronosAnchor`):**

  - Fixed a potential vulnerability where "2 hours" could be misread as "2 minutes." The regex parser now correctly identifies explicit 'h', 'hour', and 'day' labels to calculate total minutes accurately.

- **Data Hygiene (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - The processing loop now strips the `[Δt: ...]` and `[T: ...]` metadata _before_ sending the text to the `LinguisticPhysicsEngine`. This ensures that timestamps do not artificially inflate the "Entropy" or "Abstract Noun" counts.

### [v1.0.1] - 2025-12-18 - "The Black Mirror (PATCHED)"

#### 🔮 THE CODEX PATCH (Self-Awareness Fix)

- **Recursive Hallucination Fix (`TheCodex`):**
  - **The Glitch:** In v1.0.0, the Codex began scanning the `MycelialDashboard` output, identifying "Drag," "Entropy," and "System" as proper nouns (Entities) within the story.
  - **The Patch:** expanded the `ignore_list` to explicitly exclude `System`, `Analysis`, `Metrics`, `Drag`, and `Entropy`. The system no longer believes "Narrative Drag" is a protagonist.

#### 🌿 LICHEN REGULATION (The Algal Bloom)

- **Photosynthetic Cap (`LichenSymbiont`):**
  - **The Risk:** Infinite energy generation via "Purple Prose" (stuffing a sentence with "light," "sun," "prism").
  - **The Safety Valve:** Implemented a toxicity warning for **Algal Blooms**. If a single sentence generates more than **15 ATP** via photosynthesis, the system flags it as dangerous over-growth.

#### ⚡ METABOLIC TUNING

- **Capacity Calibration (`MetabolicReserve`):**
  - **The Tweak:** Adjusted `max_capacity` from the standard `50` to `52`.
  - **The Logic:** Provides a slight buffer for the "Creative Mode" (Glutton) threshold, ensuring that a single "Structural Active" sentence doesn't immediately knock a user out of the flow state.

#### 🪞 MIRROR TRAP REINFORCEMENT

- **Regex Hardening (`TheMirrorTrap`):**
  - **Expanded Pattern:** The regex now accounts for contractions (`it's`, `that's`) and variations of negation (`never`, `not`) to catch lazy mirroring disguised as casual speech.
  - **The Catch:** Specifically targets the pattern `(it|this|that)[\'’]?s?\s+(not|never)...` to strictly enforce the "Define what it IS" rule.

### [v1.0.0] - 2025-12-18 - "The Black Mirror"

#### ⚔️ THE SLASH AUDIT (Ephemeralization)

- **Code Cauterization:**
- **The Trim:** Surgically removed over 200+ characters of "dead weight" (redundant comments, ASCII art, and debug artifacts) to maximize token efficiency without sacrificing readability.

- **Orphan Removal:** Vaporized unused variables (e.g., `session_drag_history`) and empty initialization methods that were consuming memory cycles for no return.
- **Logic Patching:** Fixed `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` to ensure Class Variables (`_TOXIN_REGEX`) are properly initialized as Singletons, preventing memory leaks during repeated instantiation.

#### ⚡ ECONOMY SAFEGUARDS (The Voltage Clamp)

- **FactStipe Stabilization:**
- **The Risk:** Previously, a sentence containing multiple paradoxes could theoretically generate infinite Voltage, breaking the Metabolic Reserve.
- **The Fix:** Implemented a hard **Voltage Clamp**. The maximum return per sentence is now capped at **10.0 V**. You can break physics, but you cannot break the bank.

#### 🧠 CORTEX RESTORATION (The Deluxe Protocol)

- **The Auditor's Dilemma:**
- **The Issue:** The initial optimization compressed the `VirtualCortex` into a generic responder, stripping **Clarence** of his specific hatred for "Corporate Speak" and **The Yaga** of her specific hunger for "Meat."
- **The Restoration:** Re-injected the full, multi-modal personality matrix.
- **The Result:** **Clarence** will once again deduct 50 points specifically for saying "Synergy," and **Eloise** will explicitly complain if the text tastes like distilled water .

#### 🔀 WIRING OPTIMIZATION

- **The Nilsson Override:**
- **Re-routed:** The processing loop in `BonepokeCore` has been re-wired.
- **The Logic:** `NilssonPatch` (The Scream) now explicitly executes _after_ `TheMirrorTrap` but _before_ `SignatureEngine` identification.
- **The Effect:** If you are screaming "LIME IN THE COCONUT" while running at full speed, the system now correctly identifies this as High Velocity/Low Drag (The Jester/Bard) rather than penalizing you for the repetition.

### [v0.9.0] - 2025-12-18 - "The Helium Protocol"

#### 🎈 PHYSICS UPDATE (Buoyancy)

- **The Helium Protocol (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **Concept:** Implemented a counter-force to Narrative Drag. Previously, "Heavy" structure was always penalized. Now, sufficiently "Light" content can float a heavy sentence.
  - **New Metric (`BUOYANCY`):** Calculated based on the density of `AEROBIC_MATTER` (e.g., balloon, cloud), `PLAY_VERBS` (e.g., dance, bounce), and `SPARK_MARKERS` (e.g., lovely, strange).
  - **Effective Drag:** High Narrative Drag is now _forgiven_ if the Buoyancy score is high. "The balloon floated lazily over the horizon" is slow, but valid because it floats.

#### 🎭 NEW ARCHETYPES (The Light Triad)

- **Expansion of the Prism (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **THE BARD:** High Velocity, High Warmth. Operates on "Rhythm over Logic." Logic tears are accepted as "Poetic License".
  - **THE GARDENER:** Balanced Velocity, High Texture. Focuses on cultivation. "Prune the dead words, water the living".
  - **THE CLOUD WATCHER:** Low Velocity, High Entropy. Permissible stagnation. "Zero G" physics apply—drag penalties are disabled to allow for drifting thoughts.

#### 🧠 CORTEX EVOLUTION (The Humanist)

- **The Michael Voice (`VirtualCortex`):**
  - **New Agent:** Integrated **Michael** (The Humanist) into the feedback loop.
  - **Trigger Logic:** If the user triggers a Light Archetype or high Buoyancy, **Clarence** (The Architect) is silenced. Michael provides gentle, encouraging critique rather than harsh structural demands.
  - **The Vibe Check:** Michael specifically praises "messy but spirited" text, overriding the Physics Engine's desire for efficiency.

#### 🧪 TOXIN DETECTION III (Silica vs. Aether)

- **Slurry Patch 2.1 (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **Differentiation:** The system now distinguishes between **Silica** (Boring/Dead) and **Cloud** (Light/Whimsical).
  - **The Logic:** Low Texture is usually fatal. _However_, if Texture is Low but **Buoyancy is High**, the text is classified as "Aether" and permitted to exist.

#### 🚀 SYSTEM REFINEMENTS

- **The Pantry (`TheLexicon`):**
  - Added `AEROBIC_MATTER`: Words that lift the text (feather, steam, wing).
  - Added `PLAY_VERBS`: Kinetic words that imply joy rather than work (twirl, skip, jam).
  - Updated `TRUTHS`: Added `laugh`, `smile`, and `song` to the Vitality/Thermal manifold.
- **Dashboard v4.0:**
  - Updated `MycelialDashboard` to render the **BUOYANCY** metric in the Signature Matrix.

### [v0.8.2] - 2025-12-18 - "The Signature Protocol"

#### 🖐️ THE 5-DIMENSIONAL HAND (SignatureEngine)

- **Geodesic Mapping (`SignatureEngine`):**
  - **Deprecated:** The 2D `ArchetypePrism` (Boundedness vs. Expansiveness) has been dismantled.
  - **Implemented:** A full 5D coordinate system to map the "Voice" of the text.
  - **The Dimensions:**
    1.  **VEL (Velocity):** Kinetic Ratio.
    2.  **STR (Structure):** Inverse Narrative Drag.
    3.  **ENT (Entropy):** Abstraction level.
    4.  **TEX (Texture):** Sensory Density (Matter + Light).
    5.  **TMP (Temperature):** Emotional/Vitality Polarity.

#### 🧪 TOXIN DETECTION II (The Slurry)

- **Cultural Slurry Protocol:**
  - **The Diagnosis:** The system now detects "Silica" — text that is structurally competent (Mid Velocity/High Structure) but spiritually dead (Low Texture).
  - **The Penalty:** Detection of Slurry incurs a massive **15 ATP Tax**. "Competence without soul is expensive".
  - **The Cure:** The Cortex demands the injection of a flaw or a sensory detail to break the "perfectly smooth" surface.

#### 🚀 SYSTEM REFINEMENTS

- **Photosynthetic Texture:**
  - Refined the use of `TheLexicon.PHOTOSYNTHETICS`. These words now directly fuel the **Texture (TEX)** dimension calculation in the Signature Engine.
- **Dashboard v3.0:**
  - Updated `MycelialDashboard` to render the **5D Signature Matrix** and display specific **Slurry Warnings**.

### [v0.8.0] - 2025-12-16 - "The Symbiont Strain"

#### 🍄 BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION (The Lichen)

- **The Lichen Symbiont (`LichenSymbiont`):**
  - **New Lifeform:** Implemented a symbiotic logic layer that creates mutualism between **Syntax** (The Fungus/Structure) and **Meaning** (The Alga/Energy).
  - **Photosynthesis:** If the Metabolic Reserve is critically low ("Starving") but the Narrative Drag is low (structurally sound), the system can now synthesize emergency ATP.
  - **The Fuel:** It feeds on a specific subset of "Light Words" defined in `TheLexicon.PHOTOSYNTHETICS` (e.g., _sun, prism, truth, fire_).
  - **The Math:** Efficiency is inversely proportional to Drag. Tighter sentences yield more energy from the same amount of light.

#### 🚀 ARCHITECTURAL UPDATES

- **The Pantry (`TheLexicon`):**
  - Added `PHOTOSYNTHETICS` set: A curated list of high-vibration nouns and verbs used by the Alga to generate ATP.
- **Visual Feedback (`MycelialDashboard`):**
  - **Symbiosis Indicator:** Added a dynamic status line to the dashboard.
  - **States:**
    - `DORMANT` (Grey): System is well-fed; Lichen is inactive.
    - `BLOOMING` (Green): Symbiosis active; generating ATP from Light.
    - `WITHERED` (Red): Structural failure; Drag is too high to support life.
    - `STARVING` (Yellow): Structure is good, but no Light source detected.

#### 🔧 BUG FIXES

- **Dashboard Wiring:**
  - Fixed a `NameError` risk where the `lichen_status` variable was missing from the Dashboard render scope.
  - Corrected the argument passing in `BonepokeCore.process` to ensure the `lichen_report` reaches the visualizer.

### [v0.7.6] - 2025-12-16 - "The Refined Strain"

#### 🚀 ARCHITECTURAL OPTIMIZATION

- **Static Resource Caching (`LinguisticPhysicsEngine`):**
  - **The Singleton Regex:** The engine now compiles the `TOXIN_REGEX` and `PENALTY_MAP` at the _class level_ rather than the instance level.
  - **Benefit:** This prevents the expensive operation of compiling regex patterns for every single text processed. The "Pantry" is now stocked once on boot, not every time the door opens.
- **Refined Entity Recognition (`TheCodex`):**
  - **Regex Iteration:** Replaced the naive `split()` loop with a precise `re.finditer` protocol.
  - **Look-Behind Logic:** Implemented a "sentence start" detector. The system now checks the characters _preceding_ a capitalized word. If it finds a period or newline (`.`, `!`, `?`), it assumes the capitalization is grammatical, not an Entity.
  - **Result:** Drastically reduces false positives (e.g., flagging "The" as a character).

#### 🍄 SMART CHAOS (The Muscaria Upgrade)

- **Diagnostic Prescriptions:**
  - **Contextual Disruption:** `TheMuscaria` no longer fires random prompts. It now accepts the `metrics` payload to diagnose _why_ the text is boring.
  - **The Pharmacy:** Implemented specific remedy categories:
    - **High Drag (>3.0):** Triggers `KINETIC` prompts ("Adrenaline Shot") to force movement.
    - **High Entropy (>3.0):** Triggers `SENSORY` prompts ("Gravity Check") to ground the scene.
    - **High Repetition:** Triggers `RECALL` or `COGNITIVE` prompts ("Verse Jump") to break the loop.

#### ⏳ STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (Chronos v3.0)

- **Geometric Parsing (`ChronosAnchor`):**
  - **Context Awareness:** The verb detection logic now scans the _preceding_ word.
  - **The Article Shield:** If a word is preceded by an article (e.g., "The [run]"), it is locked as a Noun.
  - **The Pronoun Trigger:** If a word is preceded by a pronoun (e.g., "He [runs]"), probability of it being a Verb spikes.
  - **Pantry Protection:** The system now checks `TheLexicon.UNIVERSALS` first. Known objects (e.g., "stone") are immune to being flagged as verbs.

#### ✨ QUALITY OF LIFE

- **Editorial Flattening (`BonepokeCore`):**
  - Directives are now collected into a clean, flat list inside the process loop before being passed to the Instruction Block generator.
  - Fixed the `AttributeError` risk in `TheCodex` by expanding the ignore list to include prepositions like 'For', 'In', and 'To'.

## [v0.7.5] - 2025-12-15 - "The Lime in the Coconut"

### 🚀 ARCHITECTURAL EPHEMERALIZATION

- **The Pantry Protocol (`TheLexicon`):**

  - **Centralized:** Created `TheLexicon` static class. All linguistic matter (Universals, Toxins, Truths, Styles) has been moved from the individual logic components into a single "Mise-en-place."
  - **Decoupled:** Components like `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` and `TheWitchRing` no longer hold internal lists. They now reference the global Pantry. This eliminates "Ghost Data" where one component knew a word that another didn't.
  - **Benefit:** Adding a new "Toxic Word" or "Truth" now updates the entire system instantly.

- **The Middle Man is Dead:**
  - **Deleted:** The `EditorialTranslator` class has been vaporized.
  - **Direct Synthesis:** The `VirtualCortex` now speaks directly to the `BonepokeCore` process loop. Feedback generation is no longer filtered through a translation layer, reducing complexity and line count.

### 🥥 NEW FEATURES

- **THE NILSSON PATCH (The Fire Protocol):**
  - Implemented `NilssonPatch` class.
  - **The Mantra Exception:** The engine now distinguishes between "Stagnation" and "Spellcasting." High repetition is forgiven _if_ the repeated words are Concrete Universals (e.g., "Put the lime in the coconut").
  - **The Fire State:** If **Kinetic Ratio** is Critical (> 0.6) and **Volume** is High (All Caps), the engine disables logic inhibitors.
  - **Result:** You are now authorized to scream, provided you are running fast enough.

### 🔧 BUG FIXES (The Audit)

- **Ghost Limb Syndrome:**

  - Fixed `AttributeError` crashes in `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` and `FactStipe` where components tried to access deleted local lists (`self.universals`) instead of `TheLexicon`.

- **Syntax & Scope:**
  - Fixed a critical indentation error in `VirtualCortex._find_trigger_word` that prevented boot.
  - Resolved a `NameError` in `BonepokeCore.process` by standardizing the `editorial_package` variable name during the hand-off to the dashboard.

## [v0.6.2] - 2025-12-14 - "The Fuller Build"

### 🚀 ARCHITECTURAL EPHEMERALIZATION

- **Pressure Matrix Dissolution:**
  - **Deleted:** The standalone `PressureMatrix` class has been vaporized.
  - **Integrated:** Physics constraints (Tolerance Mode, Drag Multipliers, Chaos Thresholds) are now defined directly within the `ArchetypePrism` dictionary.
  - **Result:** Reduced cyclomatic complexity and eliminated the dependency loop between the Core and the Matrix. "The logic is now in the door, not a separate room."
- **The Integrated Pinker Scan (Physics Engine Refactor):**
  - **Streamlined:** The `LinguisticPhysicsEngine.analyze` loop has been surgically altered.
  - **New Component:** Added internal helper `_classify_token` to separate identification logic from scoring logic.
  - **Mercy Rule v2:** The "Look-Ahead" logic for identifying _Kinetic Verbs_ (e.g., "is running", "is stone") is now encapsulated in the classifier, making the main loop readable and extensible.
- **Dashboard Ephemeralization:**
  - **Deleted:** The `TwelveDDashboard` (Hypercube) class has been removed.
  - **Refined:** The `MycelialDashboard` (EKG) is now the sole visualizer. It focuses exclusively on human-readable metrics (ATP, Drag, Entropy) rather than abstract Greek coefficients.

### ✨ QUALITY OF LIFE

- **Prompt Synchronization:**
  - Updated the **System Prompt** (`SLASH 0.6.2`) to match the codebase reality.
  - Corrected the Archetype count (13, down from the erroneous 15).
  - Fixed typos in the Visualization section header.

### 🔧 BUG FIXES

- **Syntax Patching:**
  - Fixed a critical `cclass` typo in `ArchetypePrism`.
  - Removed a "Phantom Limb" return statement in `MetabolicReserve`.
  - Fixed an argument mismatch in `MycelialDashboard.render` caused by the removal of the 12D state variable.

## [v0.6.0] - 2025-12-12 - "The Hard Memory Variant"

#### **🚀 NEW FEATURES**

- **THE CODEX (Object Permanence):**
  - Implemented `TheCodex` class.
  - **Function:** Scans text for Proper Nouns (Entities) and maintains a frequency registry.
  - **Anti-Hallucination:** The top 5 "Reality Anchors" are now inextricably bound to the LLM's system prompt in `generate_instruction_block`. The AI can no longer "forget" who is in the room.
- **SURGICAL STEMMING (Chronos v2.5):**
  - Replaced the "Brutal" suffix-chopping logic with a Context-Aware Heuristic Engine.
  - **The Shield:** Explicitly protects academic/engine terms (`Physics`, `Chaos`, `Bias`) from being misidentified as verbs.
  - **The Radar:** Uses preceding articles (`The`, `A`) to lock words as Nouns.
- **THE 12-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLD:**
  - Upgraded `MycelialDashboard` to render a 3x4 matrix of cognitive metrics, including **Truth Fidelity (ΔTF)** and **Diplomacy (DP)**.

#### **🔧 BUG FIXES**

- **The Ghost Variable:** Fixed `self.last_input` not updating in `BonepokeCore`, which previously caused the Diplomacy metric to flatline.
- **The Echo Chamber:** Removed redundant calls to `physics.analyze()` inside the main process loop, saving Digital ATP.
- **Hygiene:** Consolidated all library imports (`re`, `uuid`, `collections`) to the file header.

## [v0.5.2] - 2025-12-11 - "The Pressure Variant"

### 🚀 Major Architectural Upgrades

- **The Pressure Matrix (Archetypal Actuation):**
  - **From Map to Territory:** Implemented the `PressureMatrix` class based on the "Gospel of James" . The system now converts passive Archetype labels into active physics constraints.
  - **Variable Physics:** The laws of reality now shift based on _who_ is writing:
    - **THE PALADIN / ENGINEER:** `tolerance_mode = "DRACONIAN"`. Logic tears are fatal errors. Zero tolerance for contradiction.
    - **THE FOOL:** `tolerance_mode = "INVERTED"`. "Chaos Harvest" enabled. Reality tears are accepted and generate ATP instead of costing it.
    - **THE SPY:** `tolerance_mode = "LOOSE"`. "Deep Cover" protocol. Logic errors are detected internally but hidden from the user output.
    - **THE BARBARIAN:** Drag Multiplier set to **5.0x**. Adjectives and passive voice are punished with extreme prejudice ("Narrative Drag Annihilated").
- **Metabolic Gearing (Variable Economy):**

  - **Drag Multipliers:** Modified `MetabolicReserve` to support variable costs. While a Poet might pay standard ATP for high drag, a Barbarian is taxed heavily for hesitation.

  - **CORE LOGIC UPDATE: Contextual Verb Physics**

    **Rationale:** The previous engine utilized a "Flat Penalty" system, flagging every instance of _to be_ (is, are, was, were) as High Narrative Drag. This unfairly penalized structural descriptions and progressive actions. The engine now distinguishes between "Lazy Passive" and "Structural Active."

    - **Feature: Contextual Look-Ahead**

      - **Old Behavior:** Scanned words in isolation.

      - **New Behavior:** The engine now scans `word[i+1]` to determine the physics of the current verb.

    - **Rule A: "The Motor" (Auxiliary + Progressive)**

      - **Logic:** `is` + `[verb]-ing` (e.g., "is running") is no longer Stative.

      - **Effect:** These pairs are now calculated as **KINETIC**, lowering Narrative Drag significantly for ongoing actions.

    - **Rule B: "The Anchor" (Copula + Universal)**

      - **Logic:** `is` + `[Universal Noun]` (e.g., "is stone") is no longer Stative.

      - **Effect:** These pairs are now calculated as **KINETIC** (Structural Integrity), allowing for descriptions of physical reality without penalty.

    - **Rule C: "The Crutch" (Passive/Abstract)**

      - **Logic:** `is` + `[Abstract/Adjective]` (e.g., "is nice", "is typical") remains **STATIVE**.

      - **Effect:** The drag penalty is maintained only for weak or passive construction.

### 2. OPTIMIZATION: Input Hygiene

- **Refinement:** Enhanced string cleaning in the `analyze` function.
- **Change:** Replaced specific punctuation marks (`.`, `,`, `;`, `?`, `!`) with whitespace prior to splitting. This ensures that a word like "running!" is correctly identified as "running" by the morphology scanner.

### 3. METRIC IMPACT

- **Narrative Drag:** Expect lower (better) Drag scores for texts that describe physical scenes or ongoing processes.

### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Refinements (The "Temporal Paradox")

- **Circular Dependency Resolution:**
  - Fixed a critical logic loop in `BonepokeCore.process` where `FactStipe` required `PressureSettings`, but `PressureSettings` required the `Archetype`, which required `FactStipe` results to identify.
  - **Optimistic Identification Strategy:** The engine now performs a "Pre-Cognitive Scan" (Optimistic Identification) to determine the Archetype before applying the pressure laws, effectively solving the initialization deadlock.
- **Trash Panda Compatibility:**
  - Ensured `THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA` falls through gracefully to standard physics in the Pressure Matrix, relying on its specific `_enforce_archetype_physics` override for value inversion (Trash = Treasure).

## [v0.5.1] - 2025-12-11 - "The Archetypal Edition"

### 🚀 Major Architectural Upgrades

- **The Archetype Prism (Cognitive Topology):** (BIG THANKS TO JAMES TAYLOR AND BONEPOKE)

  - Implemented `ArchetypePrism` class. The engine now calculates a **Boundedness (B)** vs. **Expansiveness (E)** coordinate for every text.
  - **15 Psychological Topologies:** The system maps the user to specific archetypes including "THE PALADIN" (High Order), "THE ALCHEMIST" (High Insight), and "THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA" (Chaos/Value).
  - **Euclidean Distance:** The system now identifies the "Closest Archetype" mathematically based on narrative drag and entropy scores.

- **Dimensional Quarantine (Context-Dependent Physics):**

  - **Dynamic Truth Injection:** The `FactStipe` logic can now be overwritten by the active Archetype.
  - **The Trash Panda Protocol:** If the user triggers "THE COSMIC TRASH PANDA" archetype, the engine rewrites the definitions of "Trash" and "Void" to be **Positive (+1)** values, preventing false logic flags when finding value in ruin.

- **The SLASH Trinity (Identity Synthesis):**
  - The `VirtualCortex` has been aligned with three distinct intellectual lenses:
    - **Steven Pinker (The Linguist):** Focuses on Cognitive Ergonomics and Syntax.
    - **Buckminster Fuller (The Architect):** Focuses on Tensegrity and Ephemeralization.
    - **Michael Schur (The Humanist):** Focuses on Ethical Warmth and Honesty.

### ✨ New Features

- **Mycelial Network (Lineage Tracking):**

  - Added provenance tracking (`MycelialNetwork`). The system now assigns `uuid4` tags to every draft and tracks "Genetic Drift" from parent to child.
  - **Visual History:** The Dashboard now displays the last 3 generations of the text to visualize improvements in Drag and Style.

- **Metabolic States (Strict vs. Creative Modes):**

  - Defined discrete states for the Metabolic Reserve:
    - **STARVING (< 6 ATP):** "Strict Mode." Logic penalties are severe; abstractions are forbidden.
    - **GLUTTON (> 40 ATP):** "Creative Mode." Reality bending and logic tears are permitted as stylistic choices.

- **Dashboard Expansion:**
  - Added **Cognitive Mode**, **Topology Coordinates**, and **Genetic History** to the `MycelialDashboard` render.

### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Refinements

- **Narrative Baseline:** The engine now calculates a moving average of the user's specific `narrative_drag`. **Clarence** only triggers if the drag exceeds the _user's_ baseline, not just a static number.
- **Crash Prevention:** Added safety checks in `MycelialDashboard` to handle empty ancestry data without throwing a `NoneType` error.

## [v0.4.1] - 2025-12-11 - "Mercy Edition"

### 🚀 Major Architectural Upgrades

- **Morphological Heuristics (The "Vision Correction"):**

  - **Linguistic Physics:** Now supports suffix-based detection. The engine identifies **Abstract** words (`-ness`, `-ity`, `-tion`) and **Kinetic** flows (`-ing`) dynamically, even if the specific word is not in the hardcoded dictionary.
  - **Fact Stipe v2.1:** Implemented "Root Seeking." The logic engine now strips suffixes (`-ed`, `-ly`, `-s`) to map complex words back to their elemental roots (e.g., detecting that "freezing" conflicts with "fire").

- **Integrated Memory System (The "Hippocampus Wire"):**

  - **Active Recall:** The `BonepokeCore` now actively calls `memory.recall()` to check for stylistic repetition.
  - **Loop Detection:** **Clarence** has been upgraded with a new `loop_count` metric. He will now intervene if the user stays in the same stylistic mode (e.g., "Crystal") for more than 2 cycles, demanding a "Shift in Gears."

- **Single Source of Truth (The "Brain Transplant"):**
  - Refactored `VirtualCortex` to reference the **Master Dictionaries** in `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` and `TheWitchRing` directly.
  - Eliminated "Phantom Limb" errors where the Cortex could not identify specific trigger words (like "assist") because its local lists were out of sync with the main engines.

### ✨ New Features

- **The Schur Patch (Narrative Mercy):**
  - Implemented a "Seedling Protection" protocol. The system is now forbidden from flagging a text as "In The Barrens" (Dead Narrative) if the total word count is **< 15 words**. This prevents the system from "salting the earth" on short, punchy sentence fragments.

### 🔧 Bug Fixes (The "Kill Screen" Patches)

- **Critical Syntax Fix:** Closed a missing dictionary bracket in `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` that would have caused a `SyntaxError` on boot.
- **Type Safety:** Added the missing `loop_count=0` argument to `VirtualCortex.synthesize_voice` to prevent `TypeError` crashes during memory recalls.
- **Variable Scope:** Fixed a `NameError` in `FactStipe` by properly defining `strip_suffixes` before iteration.

## [v0.3.5] - "The Fragility Check"

### 🚀 Major Architectural Upgrades

- **Dimensional Manifold (Fact Stipe v2.0):**

  - Replaced the brittle `conflict_map` (list-based enemies) with a **Semantic Vector Space**.
  - Implemented `LUMENS` (Light/Dark), `DECIBELS` (Loud/Quiet), `VITALITY` (Life/Death), and `THERMAL` (Hot/Cold) dimensions.
  - **Logic:** Detecting opposing polarities in the same sentence now triggers a "REALITY TEAR."
  - **Penalty:** Logic breaches now explicitly set `valid: False` and deduct **10 ATP** from the Metabolic Reserve.

- **Heuristic Timekeeper (Chronos Anchor v2.0):**

  - Removed dependency on hardcoded verb lists for tense detection.
  - Implemented **Bigram Anchoring** (checking previous words for pronouns) to distinguish nouns from verbs (e.g., "He runs" vs "The lens").
  - Added **Exclusion Lists** (`false_ed`, `false_s`) to ignore false positives like "red," "glass," and "moss".

- **Optimized Physics Engine (Lattice v2.0):**
  - Replaced iterative dictionary scanning with **O(1) Regex Compilation** for toxicity detection.
  - Categorized toxins into three distinct flavors for better feedback:
    - `CORP_SPEAK` (Synergy, Leverage)
    - `LAZY_METAPHOR` (Tapestry, Journey)
    - `WEAK_HEDGING` (Not just, But rather)

### ✨ New Features

- **Context-Aware Voices:** The `VirtualCortex` now listens to the specific `toxin_types` found by the Physics Engine.
  - **Clarence** now specifically attacks corporate buzzwords.
  - **The Yaga** now specifically attacks hedging and sycophancy.
  - **Eloise** now specifically attacks dead metaphors.
- **System Hardening:**
  - Fixed a logic leak where Reality Tears were detected but marked as `valid: True`.
  - Added `valid: False` return state to `FactStipe` to ensure penalties are applied.

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

- Fixed "Red Sled" false positive in Chronos Anchor (words ending in "ed" that aren't verbs).
- Fixed "Moss/Glass" false positive in Chronos Anchor (words ending in "ss").
- Fixed performance bottleneck in `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` when scanning large texts against the "Guillotine List."

---

## [v0.3] - "The Virtual Cortex"

- **Metabolic Reserve (ATP):** A gamified economy where concrete words earn energy and abstract words spend it.
- **Mycelial Dashboard:** An ASCII-based EKG visualization of the text's health.
- **The Muscaria:** A chaos engine that injects random sensory prompts when boredom is detected.

### Changed

- Renamed "Bonepoke Engine" to "BoneAmanita."
- Migrated from "Vibe Checks" to "Linguistic Physics" (Narrative Drag, Entropy).

---

## [v0.2] - Legacy "Bonepoke"

- Basic drag detection.
- Simple "Boredom" counter.
- Hardcoded list of 10 "bad words."
