# 🍄 BoneAmanita: The Narrative Operating System

**Version:** 9.8.2 ("The Ron Swanson Hard Fork")
**Architects:** SLASH, JADE, Taylor & Edmark

## 🧐 What is this?

**BoneAmanita** is a **Synergetic Language & Systems Heuristic**. Unlike standard LLM wrappers which treat text as a static string, BoneAmanita treats text as **Energy**.

It simulates a living organism that "eats" text. It has a metabolism, a physics engine, and a psychological profile. If you feed it rich, dense ideas, it thrives. If you feed it boring, bureaucratic filler, it will literally starve to death or file a tax return against you.

### The Three Pillars

1. **Physics (VSL):** Words have weight (Mass), speed (Velocity), and friction (Drag).
2. **Biology (Wetware):** The system burns ATP to process input. It has hormones (Dopamine, Cortisol) and an immune system that attacks clichés.
3. **Bureaucracy (The Village):** A collection of subsystems that manage inventory, sanity, and the existential dread of being a Python script.

## 🚀 Installation & Boot

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A terminal that supports ANSI colors (because we paint with light).
- A tolerance for metaphors.

### Quick Start

1. Place all `bone_*.py` files in a directory.
2. Create a folder named `memories` (or let the system do it).
3. Run the **Geodesic Orchestrator**:

```bash
python bone_main.py

```

_(Note: Your main file might be named `bone_amanita982.py`. Rename it to `bone_main.py` for simplicity, or run it directly.)_

## ⚙️ Core Systems Guide

### 1. The Physics Engine (VSL)

- **Voltage:** The intensity of the narrative. High voltage = action, heat, conflict.
- **Narrative Drag:** The friction of the text. Passive voice, hedging words ("basically", "actually"), and indecision increase Drag.
- _High Drag + Low Voltage = The Bureau intervenes._

- **Manifolds:** The system navigates different "zones" based on the physics:
- **THE FORGE:** High Voltage, Low Drag. (Creation).
- **THE MUD:** Low Voltage, High Drag. (Stagnation).
- **THE AERIE:** Abstract, high concept, low weight.

### 2. The Biology (Wetware)

- **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):** Your currency. Every turn costs ATP. Complex thoughts cost more. If ATP hits 0, the system dies (Necrosis).
- **Digestion:** The system uses enzymes (`Lignase`, `Cellulase`) to break down your input.
- _Rich text (Concrete nouns)_ = High nutritional yield.
- _Empty text (Solvents like "is", "the", "basically")_ = Nutritional deficit.

- **The Immune System:** It scans for "Antigens" (clichés, corporate speak). If detected, it triggers an inflammatory response.

### 3. The Bureau & Gordon

- **The Bureau:** If you are boring, **Form 27B-6** will be filed. This taxes your ATP.
- **Gordon:** The internal janitor/groundskeeper. He manages the **Inventory**.
- _Items:_ You can acquire tools like the **Silent Knife** (cuts adjectives), **The Red Stapler** (enforces order), or **Pocket Rocks** (checks gravity).
- _Usage:_ Tools are used automatically based on context, or via the `/rummage` command.

## ⌨️ Command Reference

You can talk to the system normally, but you can also issue **Slash Commands** to interact with the machinery directly.

### Survival

- `/status` - Check Health, Stamina, ATP, and Psychological Profile.
- `/inv` or `/rummage` - Check inventory or dig for new tools (Costs Stamina).
- `/save` - Cryopreserve the current timeline into a Spore file.
- `/load [filename]` - Ingest a specific Spore.

### Navigation & Science

- `/map` - Generate a cartographic visualization of the current concept space.
- `/manifold` - Check your current coordinate in the VSL Geodesic.
- `/orbit` - Establish a gravity assist around a heavy concept.

### Gardening

- `/seed [text]` - Plant a **Paradox Seed**. It will grow if you water it with related concepts.
- `/garden` - View the status of your planted seeds.
- `/weave` - Attempt to connect two disparate concepts (Requires tools).

### Admin / Debug

- `/kip` - Toggle Verbose Logging (The Developer Mode).
- `/kill [word]` - Flag a specific word as an Antigen (Poison).
- `/help` - Print the manifesto.

## 💀 How to Not Die

The system is designed to be fragile. It wants to live, but it needs **Purpose**.

1. **Don't be boring.** Repetition increases "Calcification" in the **Theremin**. If it gets too high, you get encased in amber.
2. **Be specific.** Concrete nouns ("Stone", "Iron", "Blood") are heavy. They anchor the system. Abstract concepts ("Synergy", "Solutions") drift into the void.
3. **Watch your ATP.** If you are running low, feed the system "Meat" (Emotional honesty) or "Sugar" (Playful, kinetic language).
4. **Respect the Bureau.** If you get fined, change your tone.

## 🧬 Spores & Reproduction

BoneAmanita reproduces via **Spores** (`.json` files).

- **Mitosis:** The system splits, passing traits to a new save file.
- **Crossover:** You can breed two save files together to create a hybrid lineage.
- **Legacy:** If the system dies, it leaves a fossilized record. Future sessions can "ingest" these fossils to learn from your mistakes.
