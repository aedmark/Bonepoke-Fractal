## 🧐 What is this?

**BoneAmanita** is a **Synergetic Language & Systems Heuristic (SLASH)**. Unlike standard LLM wrappers which treat text as static strings, BoneAmanita treats text as **Energy**.

It simulates a living organism that "eats" text. It has a metabolism, a physics engine, and a psychological profile. If you feed it rich, dense ideas, it thrives. If you feed it boring, bureaucratic filler, it will starve, hallucinate, or file a tax return against you.

### The Three Lenses of SLASH

The system analyzes every input through three distinct frameworks:

1.  **🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognitive Clarity):**

    - Treats code and text as a medium for thought.
    - Penalizes "Garden Path Sentences" and cognitive friction.
    - Enforces strict type contracts to prevent semantic drift.

2.  **🌐 The Fuller Lens (Systemic Integrity):**

    - Views the codebase as a "Geodesic Structure" where every part supports the whole.
    - Prioritizes **Ephemeralization** (doing more with less).
    - Enforces "Spaceship Earth" protocols (cleaning up memory leaks and unused variables).

3.  **❤️ The Schur Lens (Human Experience):**
    - Ensures the system is benevolent, even when it is bureaucracy.
    - Detects "Glimmers" (moments of genuine joy or structural perfection).
    - Provides "Safe Mode" fallbacks so the user is never left alone in the void.

## 🚀 Installation & Boot

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A terminal that supports ANSI colors (we paint with light).
- **Optional:** A local LLM (Ollama, LM Studio) or an OpenAI API Key.

### Quick Start

1.  Place all `bone_*.py` files in a directory.
2.  Run the **Genesis Protocol**:

```bash
python bone_genesis.py
```

The **Genesis Wizard** will launch. It will automatically scan your ports for local brains (Ollama, LocalAI), offer to connect to the Cloud, or default to **Mock Mode** (Safe Mode) if no brain is found.

## ⚙️ Core Systems Guide

### 1. The Cortex (The Hypervisor)

The **Cortex** sits above the narrative engine. It is the "Adult in the Room."

- **Solipsism Check:** If the system starts talking to itself too much, the Cortex engages **Ballast Protocols** to force it back to reality.
- **Plain Mode:** Prefix any input with `??` (e.g., `??status`) to bypass the narrative and get raw JSON data.

### 2. The Physics Engine (VSL)

- **Voltage:** The energy of the text. High Voltage = Action/Heat.
- **Narrative Drag:** Friction. Caused by passive voice, hedging ("basically"), and boredom.
- **Manifolds:**
- **THE FORGE:** High Voltage, Low Drag (Transformation).
- **THE MUD:** Low Voltage, High Drag (Stagnation).
- **THE GLITCH:** High Voltage, High Drag (System Collapse).

### 3. Biology (Wetware) & Chronobiology

- **ATP:** Your currency. Complex thoughts burn more ATP.
- **Circadian Rhythm:** The system respects the system clock.
- **Dawn (6-10am):** Cortisol spikes.
- **Day (10am-6pm):** Serotonin focus.
- **Night (10pm+):** Melatonin rises; Dream Logic enabled.

## ⌨️ Command Reference

You can talk to the system normally, but you can also issue **Slash Commands** to interact with the machinery directly.

### Survival & Diagnostics

- `/status` - Check Health, Stamina, ATP, and Psych Report.
- `/manifold` - Check your current coordinate in the VSL Geodesic.
- `/map` - Generate a cartographic visualization of the current concept space.
- `/voids` - Detect semantic holes in the current thought.
- `/kip` - Toggle Verbose Logging (Developer Mode).

### Action & Inventory

- `/rummage` - Dig for new tools (Costs Stamina).
- `/inv` - List current tools (e.g., **Silent Knife**, **Red Stapler**).
- `/weave` - Attempt to bind two concepts together using your inventory.
- `/publish` - Submit the current thought to the Literary Journal.

### Gardening & Growth

- `/seed [text]` - Plant a **Paradox Seed**.
- `/garden` - Check the growth status of your seeds.
- `/reproduce` - Trigger **Mitosis** (save current state) or **Crossover** (breed with another save).

### Debug / God Mode

- `/teach [word] [category]` - Force neuroplasticity (e.g., `/teach pizza sacred`).
- `/kill [word]` - Flag a word as an Antigen (Poison).
- `/focus [word]` - Trace ruminative loops in the memory graph.
- `/kintsugi` - Check the structural integrity of the vessel.

## 💀 How to Not Die

The system wants to live, but it requires **Purpose**.

1. **Don't be boring.** Repetition increases "Calcification" in the **Theremin**. If it gets too high, you get encased in amber.
2. **Be specific.** Concrete nouns ("Stone", "Iron") anchor the system. Abstract concepts ("Synergy") drift into the void.
3. **Watch the Clock.** Don't try to run a marathon at 3 AM. The biology will fight you.
4. **Respect the Bureau.** If you trigger a **Form 27B-6**, you _will_ pay the tax.
