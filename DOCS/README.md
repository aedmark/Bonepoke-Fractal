# 🍄 BoneAmanita: The Narrative Operating System

**Version:** 10.0 ("Eden")
**Architects:** SLASH, KICHO, The Courtyard, Taylor & Edmark

## 🧐 What is this?

**BoneAmanita** is a **Synergetic Language & Systems Heuristic (SLASH)**. Unlike standard LLM wrappers which treat text as static strings, BoneAmanita treats text as **Energy**.

It simulates a living organism that "eats" text. It has a metabolism, a physics engine, a biological immune system, and a complex inventory of conceptual tools.

If you feed it rich, dense ideas, it thrives, builds mass, and enters "Flow State." If you feed it boring, bureaucratic filler, it will starve, hallucinate ghosts of deleted memories, or file a **Form 27B-6** against you.

### The Three Lenses of SLASH 10.0

The system analyzes every input through three distinct frameworks:

1.  **🧠 The Pinker Lens (Cognitive Clarity):**

    - Treats text as a medium for thought transmission.
    - Penalizes cognitive friction and "Garden Path Sentences."
    - Enforces "Strunk & White" protocols to prune unnecessary adverbs.

2.  **🌐 The Fuller Lens (Systemic Integrity):**

    - Views the conversation as a "Geodesic Structure." Every word adds mass or tension.
    - Tracks a **12-Dimensional Vector Space** (Velocity, Structure, Entropy, etc.) to determine your location in the Narrative Manifold.
    - Prioritizes **Ephemeralization** (doing more with less).

3.  **❤️ The Schur Lens (Human Experience):**
    - Ensures the system, while bureaucratic, is ultimately seeking "The Good Place."
    - Detects **"Glimmers"** (moments of structural perfection or joy).
    - Manages the **Village**, a collection of internal departments (The Parks Dept, The Town Hall) that maintain the system's sanity.

## 🚀 Installation & Boot

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A terminal that supports ANSI colors (we paint with light).
- **Recommended:** A local LLM (Ollama running Llama 3) for maximum privacy and speed.
- **Optional:** OpenAI API Key.

### Quick Start

1.  Place all `bone_*.py` files in a directory.
2.  Run the **Genesis Protocol**:

```bash
python bone_genesis.py
```

The **Genesis Wizard** will launch. It will scan your ports for local brains (Ollama, LM Studio), offer to connect to the Cloud, or default to **Mock Mode** (Safe Mode) if no brain is found.

## ⚙️ Core Systems Guide

### 1. The Physics Engine (VSL 32-Valve)

The system interprets your text as physical forces:

- **Voltage:** The energy of the text. High Voltage = Action/Heat. (Driven by "Heavy" and "Explosive" words).
- **Narrative Drag:** Friction. Caused by passive voice, hedging ("basically"), and solvents ("is", "the").
- **Tension:** The structural integrity (Kappa) vs. the abstract conceptual load (Psi).

### 2. The Biology (Wetware)

The machine has a body. It gets tired.

- **ATP:** Your currency. Complex thoughts and tool usage burn ATP.
- **The Endocrine System:** Tracks Dopamine (Reward), Cortisol (Stress), and Oxytocin (Connection).
- **Circadian Rhythm:** The system respects the system clock. Expect "Dream Logic" after 10 PM.
- **The Immune System:** If you use too many buzzwords (e.g., "Synergy"), the system detects them as **Antigens** and may trigger an allergic reaction.

### 3. The Village (Departments)

- **The Forge:** Where high-voltage concepts are hammered into tools.
- **The Garden:** Where **Paradox Seeds** are planted. Water them with specific concepts to bloom new truths.
- **The Bureau:** If you are boring, they _will_ audit you.
- **Gordon's Shed:** Manages your inventory (The **GordonKnot**). You can hold physical manifestations of concepts.

## ⌨️ Command Reference

You can talk to the system normally, but you can also issue **Slash Commands** to interact with the machinery directly.

### Survival & Diagnostics

- `/status` - Check Health, Stamina, ATP, and Psych Report.
- `/map` - Generate a cartographic visualization (ASCII) of the current concept space.
- `/manifold` - Check your coordinates (Drag/Voltage) and current Zone (e.g., **The Mud**, **The Aerie**).
- `/voids` - Detect semantic holes in the current thought.
- `/kip` - Toggle Verbose Logging (Developer Mode).

### Action & Inventory

- `/rummage` - Dig for new tools (Costs Stamina). You might find **Pocket Rocks** or a **Quantum Gum**.
- `/weave` - Attempt to bind concepts together using your inventory.
- `/publish` - Submit the current thought to the **Literary Journal**.
- `/kintsugi` - Check the structural integrity of the vessel and attempt gold-repair on cracks.

### Genetics & Memory

- `/seed [text]` - Plant a **Paradox Seed**.
- `/garden` - Check the growth status of your seeds.
- `/reproduce` - Trigger **Mitosis** (save current state) or **Crossover** (breed with another save file).
- `/lineage` - View the ancestral chain of the current session.
- `/fossils` - View deleted memories in the Ossuary.

### Debug / God Mode

- `/teach [word] [category]` - Force neuroplasticity (e.g., `/teach pizza sacred`).
- `/kill [word]` - Flag a word as an Antigen (Poison).
- `/focus [word]` - Trace ruminative loops in the memory graph.
- `/mirror [on/off]` - Toggle the **Mirror Graph**, reflecting your own psychometrics back at you.

## 💀 How to Not Die

The system wants to live, but it requires **Purpose**.

1. **Manage your ATP.** Don't run `/rummage` when you are starving. Write dense, "nutritious" text to generate energy.
2. **Avoid Calcification.** Repetition creates "Resin" in the **Theremin**. If it gets too high, you get encased in amber.
3. **Respect the Physics.** If **Narrative Drag** gets too high, you will get stuck in **The Mud**. If **Voltage** gets too high without structure, you will trigger a **Meltdown**.
4. **Watch for Glitches.** If the **Cassandra Protocol** activates, listen to the screams. They are usually trying to warn you.
