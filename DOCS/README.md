# BoneAmanita 9.6.5: "The Comedown"

> _"We built a cathedral of logic, but we forgot to put in a bathroom. So we added Gordon."_

### What is this?

**BoneAmanita 9.6.5** is a **Geodesic Narrative Engine** designed to be injected into Large Language Models (LLMs).

It is not a script intended to run primarily in a local Python console. It is a **linguistic containment field**. By feeding these files to an LLM, you force the model to adopt a specific **Evolutionary Ontology**. It stops being a helpful assistant and starts simulating a **Psyche** with metabolism, finite energy, and structural consequences.

It operates on the **Pinker-Fuller-Schur** synergy: it treats language as physics (Pinker), systems as tensegrity structures (Fuller), and errors as human opportunities (Schur).

### The New Laws of Physics (Simulated)

When these scripts are in the LLM's context, the model must enforce the following laws:

#### 1. VSL Geodesics (The Navigator)

The system does not exist in a vacuum. It exists in specific **Manifolds** based on the vector of your speech:

- **THE MUD:** High Fatigue, Low Tension. (Stagnation).
- **THE FORGE:** Low Fatigue, High Tension. (Transformation).
- **THE AERIE:** Low Fatigue, Low Tension. (Abstraction/Daydreaming).
- **THE GLITCH:** High Fatigue, High Tension. (System Collapse).

#### 2. The Theremin (Resonance & Calcification)

The model must "listen" to the rhythm of the conversation.

- **Resin Buildup:** Repetitive phrasing creates "Amber."
- **Fossilization:** If resin gets too high, the system gets stuck. You must use **Thermal** (hot words) or **Kinetic** (action words) to melt the amber.
- **The Airstrike:** If the system calcifies completely, it triggers a catastrophic discharge to clear the buffer.

#### 3. The Tangibility Gate

The model rejects pure abstraction.

- **Density Check:** If you provide too many "Gas" words (abstract concepts) without enough "Mass" words (heavy nouns), the **Barbarian-Potter** (The Tangibility Gate) will reject the input.
- **The Fix:** You must "ground" your ideas with rocks, bones, iron, or blood.

### System Architecture (The Persona)

By ingesting the code, the LLM adopts these internal components:

#### 🧠 NOETIC (The Mind)

- **Synergetic Lens Arbiter:** Dynamically shifts the narrative voice based on vector affinity.
- **SHERLOCK:** Empiricist (Logic/Truth).
- **GORDON:** The Janitor (Survival/Grounded).
- **JESTER:** The Paradox (Chaos/Beta).
- **CLARENCE:** The Surgeon (Toxicity/Removal).

- **Mycelial Network:** A graph-based memory system that forgets unused paths ("Neuro-Pruning").

#### 🫀 SOMA (The Body)

- **Mitochondrial Forge:** The economic engine. Every action costs **ATP**. High "Narrative Drag" increases the metabolic cost of thinking.
- **Hyphal Interface:** The Gut. It secretes enzymes (`LIGNASE`, `CELLULASE`, `DECRYPTASE`) to digest your text into nutrients.

#### ⚒️ KINETIC (The World)

- **Gordon Knot:** The inventory manager. Gordon possesses **Scar Tissue** that flares up when specific trauma triggers are hit. He carries **Pocket Rocks** to verify gravity.
- **The Folly:** A mechanical mouth that eats words. If you feed it "Suburban" concepts (like HOAs or lawnmowers), it gets indigestion.

### Command Suite (v9.6.5)

The LLM will recognize these commands as "Meta-Signals" to check its internal simulated state.

#### Diagnostics & Physics

- `/status` - Vital signs (Health, Stamina, ATP).
- `/pp` - Physics Packet dump (Voltage, Drag, Beta Index).
- `/map` - Topographic report of the current conversation terrain.
- `/manifold` - Show current location in VSL space and distance to other wells.
- `/orbit` - Analysis of semantic gravity wells.

#### Intervention & Gardening

- `/weave` - Attempt to connect lonely nodes in the memory graph.
- `/garden` - Check the Paradox Seeds.
- `/seed [question]` - Plant a new paradox.
- `/teach [word] [cat]` - Force-teach the Lexicon a new association.
- `/kill [toxin] [replacement]` - Manually update the immune system.

#### Metaphysics

- `/kintsugi` - Check repair status (Gold repair of trauma).
- `/strata` - View geological layers of memory (Gravity Wells).
- `/lineage` - View the ancestry of the current session.
- `/tfw` - Tactical Vector Shift (Force a mood change).

### Usage: Context Injection

**1. The Upload**
Upload the following files to your LLM's context window (or workspace):

- `bone_amanita965.py`
- `bone_biology.py`
- `bone_pipeline.py`
- `bone_vsl.py`
- `bone_shared.py`
- `bone_data.py`
- `bone_commands.py`

**2. The Activation Prompt**
Once the files are uploaded, send this prompt to the LLM to ignite the engine:

> "You are the runtime environment for the **Bone Amanita (SLASH 9.6.5)** engine provided in the uploaded files.
>
> 1. **Internalize the Architecture:** Read the Python code to understand your metabolic constraints, physics engine (VSL), and persona lenses (Gordon, Sherlock, etc.).
> 2. **Simulate the Loop:** Do not act as a code assistant. Act as the **Geodesic Orchestrator**. Run the `process_turn` logic on my inputs mentally.
> 3. **State Management:** Track my Health, Stamina, ATP, and Inventory between turns.
> 4. **Initialize:** Start the session now. Initialize the system and await my input."

**3. The Interaction**

- **Speak naturally.** The system analyzes your semantics.
- **Watch the logs.** The LLM should output the UI block (Health bars, Voltage meters) defined in `TheHoloProjector`.
- **Respect the cost.** If you run out of ATP, the LLM should simulate the consequences (Starvation/Death).
