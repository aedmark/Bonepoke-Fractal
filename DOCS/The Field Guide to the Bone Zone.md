# 🦴 The Field Guide to the Bone Zone

> _"We are building a geodesic dome out of poetry and panic."_

Welcome to **Bone Amanita**. This is not a chatbot. It is a metabolic organism that feeds on your language. It has a health bar, an immune system, and an opinion about your writing style.

## 1. The Core Vitals

Just like you, the system needs energy to survive.

- **⚡ ATP (Energy):**
    
    - **What it is:** Currency. You spend ATP to process thoughts.
        
    - **How to get it:** Feed the system **Complex Nouns** (Concrete, Heavy, Structural) and **Light** (Photosynthesis).
        
    - **How to lose it:** Boredom (Repetition), Turbulence (Choppy sentences), and Starvation.
        
- **❤️ Health (Integrity):**
    
    - **What it is:** Structural cohesion. If this hits 0, the session dies (Necrosis).
        
    - **How to lose it:** High Voltage shocks, Toxin buildup (using "business speak" like _synergy_ or _utilize_), and Cassandra Events (screaming into the void).
        
- **🔋 Stamina (Willpower):**
    
    - **What it is:** The ability to resist the Void.
        
    - **Mechanic:** If Stamina is low, you cannot hold onto "Abstract" concepts. They will slip through your fingers.
        
    - **Fix:** Eat a "Stability Pizza" or use "Heavy" words to ground yourself.
        

## 2. The Physics of Language

The system analyzes your text through three physical dimensions:

### A. Voltage (🔥 Heat / Intensity)

- **Low Voltage (0-5v):** The Mud. Safe, but stagnant. Nothing grows here.
    
- **Mid Voltage (5-15v):** The Garden. The sweet spot. Metaphors bloom.
    
- **High Voltage (15v+):** The Forge. Dangerous. Can shatter the "Theremin" (the resin system). High risk, high reward.
    
- **How to raise it:** Use "Explosive" verbs (_crash, burn, shatter_) and "Heavy" nouns (_stone, iron, bone_).
    

### B. Narrative Drag (⚓ Friction)

- **What it is:** The resistance of the medium.
    
- **High Drag:** It feels like walking through molasses. It costs more ATP to do anything.
    
- **Causes:** Passive voice, excessive adjectives, hedging words (_maybe, perhaps, sort of_), and "Solvents" (_is, was, the_).
    
- **The Cure:** Gordon's **Silent Knife**. Cut the fluff. Be direct.
    

### C. Kappa (🏗️ Structural Integrity)

- **What it is:** How well your concepts connect to each other.
    
- **Low Kappa:** Word salad. A pile of loose bricks.
    
- **High Kappa:** A cathedral. Concepts are linked by "Gravity" (semantic relevance).
    
- **How to raise it:** Call back to previous concepts. Build on what you've already established.
    

## 3. The Zones (Where are we?)

The **Navigator** tracks your location in the "Geodesic Manifold" based on your writing style.

|Zone|Description|Conditions|
|---|---|---|
|**THE MUD**|Safe, boring, expensive movement.|High Drag, Low Voltage.|
|**THE FORGE**|Hot, transformative, dangerous.|High Voltage, Low Fatigue.|
|**THE AERIE**|Abstract, airy, thin atmosphere.|Low Drag, Low Tension.|
|**THE GARDEN**|Balanced. The goal.|Good mix of Structure & Truth.|
|**THE GLITCH**|Reality failure.|High Tension + High Fatigue.|
