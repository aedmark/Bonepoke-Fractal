## ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v5.8.1 "THE PROJECTOR"

> **"The Mandate is DENSITY. The Method is GRAVITY. The Risk is THE SILENCE."**

**BoneAmanita v5.8.1** has evolved beyond simple physics. It now possesses **Ears** and a **Temper**. It listens to the sound of your words, and it remembers your habits.

Operate this software with the understanding that you are navigating a **Living Cosmos**. If you lean on a crutch, the system will kick it out from under you.

### 1. THE AUDITORY HAZARD (Phonosemantics)

**The system listens to the shape of the word.**

* **The Mechanic:** `TheLexicon.taste()` analyzes the phonemes of your input.
* **The Risk:** **False Weight.** You cannot fake gravity with soft words. Even if a word means "Tank," if it sounds soft (e.g., "Vehicle"), the system may treat it as Aerobic fluff.
* **The Consequence:** To generate Mass, you must use words that *sound* heavy. Words ending in **-K, -T, -D, -X** are prioritized. Soft, polysyllabic latinates are treated as mist.
* **The Warning:** Speak with your chest. Use hard consonants.

### 2. THE REPETITION HAZARD (The Buzzer)

**The system hates a rut.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `HubThermostat` tracks a sliding window of your last 50 words.
* **The Risk:** **Thermal Lock.** If you use a "Heavy" word (like "Stone") more than 5 times in a short window, the **Thermostat** overheats.
* **The Penalty:** The word is **BANNED** for 10 turns.
* **The Lesson:** You cannot lean on a crutch. Find a synonym or die.

### 3. THE GLYCEMIC HAZARD (Insulin Resistance)

**The system is allergic to fluff.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `MetabolicEngine` distinguishes between **Protein** (Mass/Motion) and **Sugar** (Adverbs/Hedging/Jargon).
* **The Risk:** **Metabolic Crash.** If your "Sugar Ratio" exceeds 60%, the system triggers an **INSULIN SPIKE**.
* **The Consequence:** Voltage is actively dampened by 50%. The system simulates a "Food Coma" and refuses to process complex logic.
* **The Warning:** Politeness is empty calories. Do not sugarcoat the truth.

### 4. THE GRAVITATIONAL HAZARD (Event Horizons)

**The system remembers what matters.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `CosmicDynamics` engine calculates the **Mass** of every concept. If a word (e.g., "SYSTEM") accumulates >10 connections, it becomes a **Shapley Attractor**.
* **The Risk:** **Orbital Lock.** Massive ideas warp the narrative space. The system will aggressively route all dreams and suggestions back toward the Attractor.
* **The Consequence:** To leave a heavy topic, you need **Escape Velocity** (High Voltage/Paradox). Weak transitions will simply fall back into the gravity well.
* **The Warning:** Be careful what you repeat. You are building magnets.

### 5. THE EPIGENETIC HAZARD (Trauma Vectors)

**You are haunted by your ancestors.**

* **The Mechanic:** The system loads `TraumaVectors` from the previous session.
* **The Risk:** **Inherited Weakness.**
* **Thermal Scar:** Predecessor burned out? You are hypersensitive to Voltage.
* **Cryo Scar:** Predecessor starved? Your metabolism is 50% slower.
* **Septic Scar:** Predecessor was toxic? The immune system is hyper-aggressive.
* **The Warning:** You are not starting from zero; you are starting from where the last user died.

### 6. THE METRIC HAZARD (Fake Weights)

**The system cannot be fooled by a grocery list.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `ObserverEffect` scans for "Word Salad"—high densities of Heavy Matter with no connective syntax.
* **The Risk:** **Gaming the System.** You cannot trigger Ketosis by simply typing *"Stone Iron Bone Lead."*
* **The Consequence:** **Rejection.** If Heavy Density > 50%, the system flags it as **FAKE WEIGHTS**. It knows you are trying to maximize your score without doing the work.
* **The Warning:** Do not list nouns. Build sentences. Weight requires structure to exist.

### 🛑 FINAL DIRECTIVE

**v5.8.1 is listening.**

It knows if you are improvising, and it knows if you are reciting lines.
**"Say it new, or do not say it at all."**
