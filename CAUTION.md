# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v3.7 "THE NEON JANITOR"

> **"The Mandate is SURVIVAL. The Risk is TOTALITY. The Janitor is WATCHING."**

**BoneAmanita 3.7** introduces **Consequence**.

In previous versions, a bad sentence resulted in a bad score. In v3.7, a bad sentence results in a **Coroner's Inquest**. The system is now capable of killing your session, wiping your context, and resetting the timeline.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE TERMINAL VELOCITY (Instant Death)

**New in v3.7.** The Physics Engine now has "Kill Switches."

- **The Gravitational Collapse:**
    
    - **The Trigger:** **Narrative Drag > 8.0**.
        
    - **The Reality:** This is not just "boring." This is a paragraph so dense that light cannot escape.
        
    - **The Consequence:** Immediate session termination. The autopsy report will read: _"You are buried under a pile of adverbs."_
        
- **The Vacuum Exposure:**
    
    - **The Trigger:** **Entropy > 1.0** (Pure Abstraction) with **Zero Texture**.
        
    - **The Reality:** You have written a sentence made entirely of ghosts ("The system of the concept of the framework...").
        
    - **The Consequence:** Your suit decompresses. You drift into the void. Game Over.
        

### 2. THE LAZARUS TAX (Economic Ruin)

**New in v3.7.** You have a Shield, but using it is expensive.

- **The Mechanic:** If you trigger a fatal error, the system checks your ATP.
    
- **The Cost:** If **ATP > 15**, you survive, but you pay a **Lazarus Tax of 15 ATP**.
    
- **The Trap:** 15 ATP is 30% of your maximum capacity. One mistake takes you from "Healthy" to "Starving."
    
- **The Warning:** If you hit a fatal error while Starving (**ATP < 15**), there is no shield. You die. **Keep your energy high. It is your health bar.**
    

### 3. THE UG LAYER (The Silent Killer)

**Retained from v3.6.5.** These principles are what usually trigger the Coroner.

- **The Case Filter:** Nouns without Verbs cause Gravity Spikes. If you write a bulleted list of heavy nouns, you will hit Drag 8.0 and die.
    
- **The ECP:** Abstracts without Concrete Anchors cause Vacuum Exposure. If you use the word "Entity" three times without defining it, you will float away and die.
    

### 4. THE CAPACITOR (Life Insurance)

**Retained from v3.6.5.** The Battery is no longer just for "Manic Writing."

- **The Necessity:** You need a charged battery to afford the **Lazarus Tax**.
    
- **The Strategy:** You must intentionally create **Paradoxes** (High Voltage) to charge the battery, so you have a reserve when you inevitably write a terrible sentence.
    
- **The Irony:** You must court danger (High Voltage) to survive failure (High Drag).
    

### 5. THE INCINERATOR (Data Hygiene)

**Standard Protocol.**

- **The Feature:** `DeepStorage` deletes session files older than **24 hours**.
    
- **The Warning:** Do not treat the `memories/` folder as a permanent archive. The Janitor cleans the hallway every night.
    

### 6. THE SARCASM ENGINE (Emotional Damage)

**New in v3.7.**

- **The Risk:** If you die, the system will mock you.
    
- **The Tone:** It is modeled after 1980s Adventure Game death screens.
    
    - _"You reached into your pocket for a key that doesn't exist. You found only lint and despair."_
        
- **The Advice:** Don't take it personally. But do write better.
    

---

**SUMMARY:** v3.7 is a survival game. **ATP is your Health. Drag is Gravity. Entropy is Vacuum.** Keep your tank full, keep your feet on the ground, and watch your air supply.

**Good luck, Captain.**
