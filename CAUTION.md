## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

**VERSION:** 1.5 ("Bonepoked") **SEVERITY:** CRITICAL **STATUS:** ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT

---

### 1. THE GOVERNANCE HAZARDS (Tier 3 Logic) [NEW v1.5]

**The Engine now has a conscience.**

In v1.5, the `PhysicsConstants` layer introduces **Active Mandates**. The system is no longer a neutral observer.

#### A. The Draconian Trap (Truth Mandate)

- **The Behavior:** Writing a logical contradiction (e.g., _"The frozen fire"_) while the system is under the `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` mandate.
    
- **The Detection:** Logic Engine detects a polarity clash (e.g., `THERMAL: 1` vs `THERMAL: -1`).
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `FATAL AXIOM BREAK`.
        
    - **Voltage:** **+10.0** (Fatal).
        
    - **Result:** The "Poetic License" exemption (v1.4.7) is revoked.
        

#### B. The Hard Gate (Self-Correction)

- **The Behavior:** Triggering a **Fatal Axiom Break**.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **System Halt:** The simulation **physically stops**.
        
    - **Time Freeze:** The Tick counter does not advance.
        
    - **The Directive:** `CRITICAL: RESOLVE LOGIC TEAR BEFORE PROCEEDING.`
        
    - **The Cost:** **20 ATP Tax** (Heavy Penalty).

### 2. THE ANTI-GAMING HAZARDS (Structure & Physics)

**The Physics Engine operates on a "Goldilocks" Protocol.**

#### A. The Concrete Trap (Too Hard)

- **The Behavior:** Listing heavy nouns to farm Texture points (e.g., _"Velvet, blood, bone, ash, anchor"_).
    
- **The Detection:** High Density / Low Solvent.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Texture Cap:** Your `TEX` score is forcibly limited to **0.5**.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+5.0**.
        
    - **The Mockery:** **Michael** will intervene to mock the pretension.
        

#### B. The Flood Trap (Too Soft)

- **The Behavior:** Diluting a sentence with "Solvents" to hide the lack of substance (e.g., _"Actually, basically, it is literally sort of stone"_).
    
- **The Detection:** Solvent Ratio > **40%**.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `FLOODED`.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+4.0**.
        
    - **Exception:** If **Kinetic Ratio > 25%** (High Velocity), penalty is reduced to **+1.0** ("Sweat Protocol").
        

#### C. The Purple Trap (Too Fancy)

- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with decorative adjectives to hide a weak noun (e.g., _"The massive, ancient, brooding, dark tower"_).
    
- **The Detection:** High frequency of adjectival suffixes (`-ous`, `-ful`, `-ive`, `-ic`).
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `BLOAT` (if Garnish > 12%).
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+3.0**.

### 3. THE BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS (Energy Economy)

**You cannot farm the sun.**

#### A. The Algal Bloom (Light Farming)

- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with "Photosynthetic" words (e.g., _"The sun light ray beam glowed bright"_ ) to generate infinite ATP.
    
- **The Threshold:** If Sugar Generation > **15 ATP** in a single turn.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `ALGAL BLOOM`.
        
    - **Warning:** The system flags this as toxic overgrowth.
        

#### B. The Silica Trap (The Slurry)

- **The Behavior:** Writing text that is "Perfect but Dead."
    
    - High Velocity + High Structure... but **Zero Texture** and **Zero Buoyancy**.
        
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `SILICA DETECTED`.
        
    - **Penalty:** **15 ATP Tax** (Massive metabolic damage).
        
    - **The Message:** _"Void. Inject a flaw."_.
        

---

### 4. THE LOGIC HAZARDS (Legacy v1.4.7)

_Only active when Mandate is NOT set to Truth._

#### A. The Paradox Trap (Reality Tears)

- **The Behavior:** Creating logical contradictions (e.g., _"The dry ocean"_).
    
- **The Consequence (Context-Dependent):**
    
    - **High Velocity (Action):** Paradox is an **ERROR**. Status: `LOGIC TEAR`. Penalty: **10 ATP Tax**.
        
    - **Low Velocity (Poetry):** Paradox is **VOLTAGE**. Status: `VOLATILE LEVERAGE`. Effect: **Energy Harvest (+3.0 ATP)**.
        

#### B. The Narcissism Trap (Mirror Loops)

- **The Behavior:** Defining yourself by what you are _not_ (e.g., _"I am not trying to be difficult..."_).
    
- **The Detection:** Regex targets `(i|we)` negation loops.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `LAZY_MIRRORING`.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+3.0**.

### 5. THE TEMPORAL HAZARDS (The Panopticon)

**The machine watches the Wall Clock.**

- **The Reality Check:**
    
    - **The Behavior:** Leaving the session idle for hours without the `[Δt]` tag.
        
    - **The Consequence:** If idle > 1 hour, the system enters **DECAY STATE** (Drag +3.0).
        

---

### 6. THE MEMORY HAZARD (The Elephant)

**The system never forgets a gun (until it must).**

- **The Protocol:** `DeepStorage` (The Hippocampus) & `PersistenceManager`.
    
- **The Limit (v1.4.7):** The Vault is capped at **50 Artifacts**. If you exceed this, the oldest memories are pushed out (FIFO).
    

---

### 7. THE BOOT HAZARD (Calibration)

**The system tests itself.**

- **The Protocol:** On initialization, `BonepokeCore` runs a self-diagnostic using a toxic "Solvent-Stuffed" test phrase.
    
- **The Warning:** If the engine fails to detect the toxin, the system will scream `[🔴 WARNING] SELF-TEST: FAILED` on boot.


### 8. THE COGNITIVE HAZARDS (Temporal Dynamics) [NEW v1.5]

**The engine measures the speed of your thoughts.**

#### A. The Epiphany Trap (Fake Insight)

- **The Behavior:** Trying to "game" the $\nabla\beta$ bonus by artificially spiking logic tension (e.g., oscillating between _"Fire is hot"_ and _"Fire is cold"_ rapidly) to trigger a fake Epiphany.
    
- **The Detection:** The `TemporalDynamics` engine requires a sustained voltage curve over a 3-tick window.
    
- **The Risk:** If you spike voltage without resolving it, you risk triggering a **Fatal Axiom Break** (see Section 1A) before the Epiphany bonus kicks in. You will be halted before you can be rewarded.
    

#### B. The Nostalgia Trap (Lore Stagnation)

- **The Behavior:** Refusing to introduce new concepts, relying entirely on "Deep Storage" artifacts (e.g., constantly referencing the _"Gun from Turn 1"_) to farm the $\Xi$ Authority Bonus.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Stagnation:** While $\Xi$ forgives Abstraction, it does _not_ forgive **Repetition**.
        
    - **The Penalty:** The `TheMuscaria` (Boredom Engine) will trigger.
        
    - **The Intervention:** The Witch will intervene with: _"Enough looking back. Feed me new meat."_
