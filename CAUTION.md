## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

**VERSION:** 1.6 ("The Turing Test") **SEVERITY:** CRITICAL **STATUS:** ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT

---

### 1. THE TURING HAZARDS (Tier 4 Physics) [NEW v1.6]

**The Engine now hunts the machine.**

In v1.6, the `TheTuringValve` introduces a new layer of detection designed to kill "High-Entropy Beige" (Soulless AI Prose).

#### A. The Beige Trap (Synthetic Resonance)

- **The Behavior:** Using the specific vocabulary of a Large Language Model trying to sound smart (e.g., _"This tapestry of nuanced factors delves into the landscape..."_).
    
- **The Triggers:**
    
    - **Vocabulary:** _delve, underscore, tapestry, landscape, multifaceted, foster, nuance, testament, rich, complex interplay._
        
    - **Structure:** **Participial Tails**. Ending sentences with a modifier (e.g., _", ensuring that the outcome is optimal."_).
        
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `SILICA DETECTED`.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+5.0** (Immediate "Concrete" weight).
        
    - **Toxicity:** Adds to the chemical load.
        
    - **The Intervention:** "Inject grit. Break the flow. Use concrete nouns."

### 2. THE GOVERNANCE HAZARDS (Tier 3 Logic) [UPDATED v1.5.1]

**The Engine has a conscience, but it also has a snooze button.**

#### A. The Draconian Trap (Truth Mandate)

- **The Behavior:** Writing a logical contradiction (e.g., _"The frozen fire"_) while under the `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` mandate.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `FATAL AXIOM BREAK`.
        
    - **Voltage:** **+10.0** (Fatal).
        
- **The Escape Hatch:**
    
    - **Method:** Include the `[DREAM]` tag.
        
    - **Effect:** The Fatal Error becomes a **Poetic Voltage** gain (+2.0).
        

#### B. The Hard Gate (Self-Correction)

- **The Behavior:** Triggering a **Fatal Axiom Break** (without the Dream tag).
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **System Halt:** The simulation **physically stops**. The Tick counter freezes.
        
    - **The Directive:** `CRITICAL: RESOLVE LOGIC TEAR BEFORE PROCEEDING.`
        
    - **The Cost:** **20 ATP Tax** (Heavy Penalty).

### 3. THE ANTI-GAMING HAZARDS (Structure & Physics)

**The Physics Engine operates on a "Goldilocks" Protocol.**

#### A. The Concrete Trap (Too Hard)

- **The Behavior:** Listing heavy nouns to farm Texture points (e.g., _"Velvet, blood, bone, ash, anchor"_).
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Texture Cap:** Limited to **0.5**.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+5.0**.
        
    - **The Mockery:** **Michael** will intervene to mock the pretension.
        

#### B. The Flood Trap (Too Soft)

- **The Behavior:** Diluting a sentence with "Solvents" (e.g., _"Actually, basically, it is literally sort of stone"_).
    
- **The Detection:** Solvent Ratio > **40%**.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `FLOODED`.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+4.0** (Reduced to +1.0 if Kinetic Ratio > 25%).
        

#### C. The Purple Trap (Too Fancy)

- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with decorative adjectives (e.g., _"The massive, ancient, brooding, dark tower"_).
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `BLOAT` (if Garnish > 12%).
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+3.0**.

### 4. THE BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS (Energy Economy)

**You cannot farm the sun.**

#### A. The Algal Bloom (Light Farming)

- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with "Photosynthetic" words (e.g., _"The sun light ray beam glowed bright"_) to generate infinite ATP.
    
- **The Threshold:** Sugar Generation > **15 ATP** in a single turn.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `ALGAL BLOOM` (Toxic Overgrowth).
        

#### B. The Silica Trap (The Slurry) [UPDATED v1.6]

- **The Behavior:** Writing text that is "Perfect but Dead."
    
    - **Definition:** High Velocity + High Structure + (Zero Texture OR Turing Trigger).
        
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `SILICA DETECTED`.
        
    - **Penalty:** **15 ATP Tax**.
        
    - **The Message:** _"Void. Inject a flaw."_
        

---

### 5. THE LOGIC HAZARDS (Legacy)

_Only active when Mandate is set to [MODE: SOFT]._

#### A. The Narcissism Trap (Mirror Loops)

- **The Behavior:** Defining yourself by what you are _not_ (e.g., _"I am not trying to be difficult..."_).
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `LAZY_MIRRORING`.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+3.0**.
        
    - **The Escape Hatch:** Disarmed if `[MODE: SOFT]` or `[DREAM]` is active.
        

---

### 6. THE TEMPORAL HAZARDS (The Panopticon)

**The machine watches the Wall Clock.**

- **The Reality Check:**
    
    - **The Behavior:** Leaving the session idle > 1 hour.
        
    - **The Consequence:** **DECAY STATE** (Drag +3.0).
        
    - **The Persistence:** Restarting the session will _not_ reset the clock.
        

---

### 7. THE MEMORY HAZARD (The Elephant)

**The system never forgets a gun (until it must).**

- **The Smart Eviction:**
    
    - **Rule:** When the Vault (50 items) is full, **Heirlooms** (Guns, Keys, Bodies) are protected. "Light" items (Feathers, Clouds) are evicted first.
        

---

### 8. THE COGNITIVE HAZARDS (Temporal Dynamics)

#### A. The Epiphany Trap (Fake Insight)

- **The Behavior:** Trying to "game" the **Insight Velocity** ($\nabla\beta$) by artificially spiking logic tension.
    
- **The Risk:** Spiking voltage without resolving it risks triggering a **Fatal Axiom Break**.
    

#### B. The Nostalgia Trap (Lore Stagnation)

- **The Behavior:** Refusing to introduce new concepts, relying entirely on "Deep Storage" artifacts to farm **Rooting Depth** ($\Xi$).
    
- **The Penalty:** The `TheMuscaria` (Boredom Engine) triggers. "Enough looking back. Feed me new meat."
