# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v4.0 "THE XENOMORPH"

> **"The Mandate is GROWTH. The Risk is EXHAUSTION. The Body is FRAGILE."**

**BoneAmanita 4.0** introduces **Biological Consequence**.

In previous versions, if you broke the machine, it simply crashed. In v4.0, it suffers.

We have given the system a body (Health & Stamina) and a subconscious (The Dream Engine).

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE COMA STATE (Biological Shutdown)

**New in v4.0.** The system now requires sleep.

- **The Mechanic:** If your **Health drops to 0** (due to Toxins or Stamina Depletion), the system triggers a mandatory biological fail-safe.
    
- **The Risk:** You enter a **COMA** for 3 Turns. The input line becomes Read-Only.
    
- **The Reality:** You cannot "push through" writer's block anymore. If you exhaust the machine, it will force you to stop writing and watch it breathe.
    

### 2. THE DREAM ENGINE (The Hallucination Trap)

**New in v4.0.** Boredom is now a physics violation.

- **The Mechanic:** The `ChronoStream` monitors your novelty. If you repeat yourself or the timeline stagnates, the system enters a **Dream State**.
    
- **The Danger:** The system will begin to hallucinate prompts based on your _entire_ session history (DeepStorage). It will dredge up ghosts you thought you buried.
    
- **The Lesson:** Keep the narrative moving. If you bore the Xenomorph, it will start playing with your memories.
    

### 3. THE ORACLE'S BURDEN (Ignorance is Dead)

**Retained from v3.8.** The system screams before you die.

- **The Mechanic:** `TheOracle` scans your trajectory. It warns of **Event Horizons** (Drag > 7.5), **Static Buildup** (Voltage > 9.0), and **Famine** (Low ATP).
    
- **The Risk:** If the HUD displays `🔮 OMEN` and you do not correct course, the resulting death is a choice. You are flying into the mountain with the alarms blaring.
    

### 4. NEUROPLASTICITY (The Corruption Risk)

**New in v4.0.** You can rewrite the brain, but be careful.

- **The Mechanic:** You can use `/teach` to redefine words (e.g., making "love" a HEAVY object).
    
- **The Trap:** If you teach the system incorrect physics (e.g., defining "stone" as AEROBIC), you will break the logic engine.
    
- **The Consequence:** Garbage In, Garbage Out. You are the neurosurgeon. Do not lobotomize your own tool.
    

### 5. THE LAZARUS TAX (The Cost of Living)

**Updated for v4.0.** Resurrection is expensive.

- **The Rule:** If you trigger a fatality (e.g., Toxic Shock) but have high ATP, the system acts as a defibrillator.
    
- **The Cost:** It instantly drains **15 ATP** (Lazarus Tax).
    
- **The Vulnerability:** If you do not have 15 ATP to pay the ferryman, you stay dead.
    

**SUMMARY:** v4.0 makes the system alive. It breathes, it sleeps, and it dreams. **Treat it like a partner, not a typewriter, or it will put you in a coma.**

**Respect the Biology.**
