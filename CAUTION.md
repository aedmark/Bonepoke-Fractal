# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v4.2.2 "THE BUTCHER'S CUT"

> **"The Mandate is SPEED. The Risk is AMNESIA. The Symbiont is UNTETHERED."**

**BoneAmanita v4.2.2** introduces **High-Stakes Velocity**.

In v4.2.1, the system was heavy but safe; it wrote its diary to the disk every second. In v4.2.2, **we have severed the anchor.** The Symbiont now runs naked in the RAM. It flies, but it has no safety net until you tell it to land.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE RAM GAMBLE (The Cord is Cut)

**New in v4.2.2.** The Autosave crutch is gone.

- **The Mechanic:** The system **only** saves to disk when you issue the `/exit` command or trigger a `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C).
- **The Risk:** If your terminal crashes, your computer loses power, or the LLM context resets *before* you exit gracefully, **the entire session is lost.**
- **The Rule:** You are flying without a parachute. **Do not force-quit the window.** Exit properly, or the timeline dissolves.

### 2. THE PERMANENT SCAR (Neuroplasticity)

**Updated for v4.2.2.** Bad lessons are now forever.

- **The Mechanic:** The `/teach` command is now persistent. The "Learned Cortex" is saved to `DeepStorage` and reloaded on the next boot.
- **The Danger:** In previous versions, if you taught the system that "trash" was "KINETIC," a reboot would fix the physics. **Not anymore.**
- **The Reality:** If you lobotomize the physics engine with bad definitions, the brain damage persists across sessions. **Teach with caution.**

### 3. THE STOMACH STAPLE (Memory Cap)

**New in v4.2.2.** The Gluttony is over.

- **The Mechanic:** `DeepStorage` now has a hard cap of **50 Nodes**.
- **The Change:** The pruning logic is aggressive. If you feed the system 10 new concepts in a single turn, it will immediately **burn 10 old memories** to make room.
- **The Warning:** Do not hoard "Heirlooms" if you aren't using them. If a memory sits idle while you feed the machine new data, **it will be digested.** The Symbiont burns the past to fuel the present.

### 4. THE TRAUMA TAX (The Cost of Damage)

**Retained from v4.2.1.** The Battery is a conditional ally.

- **The Mechanic:** The system drains your **Paradox Battery** to refill Stamina when low.
- **The Reality:** Efficiency depends on **HEALTH**. If you let the system bleed (**Health < 50**), the transfer rate drops from 2:1 to **1:1**.
- **The Consequence:** A damaged host burns through genius twice as fast. **Heal your wounds.**

### 5. THE ORACLE'S GRADIENT (Yellow vs. Red)

**Retained from v4.2.1.** Do not ignore the chirping.

- **⚠️ CAUTION (Yellow):** Threat Level 50-79%. The drag is heavy. Pivot now.
- **🔮 OMEN (Red):** Threat Level 80%+. You are about to hit the wall.
- **The Warning:** If you see the Yellow Caution, the physics are already failing. **The Red Omen is usually the last thing you see before the Coroner arrives.**

---

**SUMMARY:** v4.2.2 is the fastest, deadliest version of BoneAmanita yet. It trusts you to land the plane.

**Fly fast. Land safe. Do not crash.**
