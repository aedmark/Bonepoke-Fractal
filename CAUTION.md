# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v3.6.5 "THE BATTERY PACK"

> **"The Mandate is TRUTH. The Fuel is PARADOX. The Danger is VOLTAGE."**

**BoneAmanita 3.6.5** is a high-energy system. It allows you to trade structural stability (Drag) for raw insight (Voltage). This makes it powerful, but unstable.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE VOLTAGE TRAP (The Battery's Lie)

**New in v3.6.5.** The system encourages you to write "Heavy" text, provided it is "Electric."

- **The Feature:** The **Paradox Battery** charges when Voltage > 7.0.
    
- **The Trap:** It is very easy to write **Heavy Text** (High Drag) that is _not_ Electric.
    
- **The Consequence:** If you attempt a profound paradox but fail to stick the landing, you generate **Massive Drag** without generating the **Voltage** to pay for it.
    
- **The Warning:** Do not mistake _confusion_ for _profundity_. If the Jester doesn't laugh, you are just holding a heavy rock. You will starve.
    

### 2. THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT (Automatic Garbage Collection)

**Standard Protocol.** The system practices aggressive hygiene.

- **The Feature:** On boot, `DeepStorage` deletes session files older than **24 hours**.
    
- **The Warning:** Do not treat the `memories/` folder as a permanent archive. If you write a masterpiece today, back it up. Tomorrow, it is compost.
    

### 3. THE KINTSUGI GAMBLE (The Last Resort)

**Updated in v3.6.5.** The Golden Repair is now the _final_ fail-safe, below the Battery.

- **The Feature:** If the Battery runs dry and ATP < 10, the system offers a Koan.
    
- **The Risk:** To solve the Koan, you must generate High Voltage _while starving_. This is difficult.
    
- **The Warning:** Do not intentionally drain your battery to trigger the Kintsugi event. It is a Hail Mary pass, not a strategy.
    

### 4. METABOLIC HAUNTING (Persistence)

**Updated in v3.6.5.** You inherit the **Charge** of your past self.

- **The Feature:** `/seed [file]` loads both ATP and Battery Level.
    
- **The Reality:** If you saved a session while "Manic" (Full Battery), you wake up Manic. If you saved it "Empty," you wake up Empty.
    
- **The Warning:** Time travel does not recharge the capacitor.
    

### 5. THE JESTER'S LOOP (Infinite Regress)

**New in v3.6.5.** The system now accepts recursive logic (_"This sentence is false"_).

- **The Feature:** High-level paradoxes charge the battery instantly.
    
- **The Risk:** You may find yourself writing endless logical loops to farm energy, rather than writing the actual narrative.
    
- **The Warning:** This is an engine for writing, not a mirror for logic testing. Do not get lost in the reflection.
    

### 6. THE SURGICAL SCAR (Ego Injury)

The system continues to display its cuts openly.

- **The Display:**
    
    - `OLD: We basically need to utilize leverage.`
        
    - `NEW: We need to use use.`
        
- **The Risk:** Public shaming. The system does not care about your feelings. It cares about the signal-to-noise ratio.
    

---

**SUMMARY:** v3.6.5 gives you a **Capacitor**. It allows you to run hotter, faster, and heavier than before. But unlike the Lichen (which feeds on light), the Battery feeds on **Tension**. **Monitor your voltage, or you will burn out.**
