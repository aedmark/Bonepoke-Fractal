# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v3.8 "DELOREAN EDITION"

> **"The Mandate is PRECOGNITION. The Risk is HUBRIS. The Future is VISIBLE."**

**BoneAmanita 3.8** introduces **The Burden of Knowledge**.

In v3.7.6, you could claim ignorance. You could say you didn't know the Drag was critical until the floor collapsed. You could say you didn't know the Voltage was lethal until the battery exploded.

**v3.8 removes the excuse.** We have installed an Oracle. The system now screams before you die.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE ORACLE'S BURDEN (Ignorance is Dead)

**New in v3.8.** The system now predicts fatalities before they happen.

- **The Mechanic:** `TheOracle` scans your trajectory. It warns of **Event Horizons** (Drag > 6.5), **Static Buildup** (Voltage > 6.5), and **Vacuum Leaks** (Entropy > 0.8).
    
- **The Risk:** If the HUD displays `🔮 OMEN` and you do not correct course, the resulting death is a choice. You are flying into the mountain with the alarms blaring.
    
- **The Reality:** There is no mercy for pilots who ignore the terrain pull-up warning.
    

### 2. THE MEMORY TRAP (Smart Spores)

**New in v3.8.** The Mycelial Network is no longer random; it is sticky.

- **The Mechanic:** `pollinate()` now prioritizes **Recency**. It hands you the heavy object you _just_ buried, not a random word from an hour ago.
    
- **The Trap:** You cannot escape your immediate context. If you drop a "Gun" in tick 10, the system will hand it back to you in tick 11 if you start drifting.
    
- **The Consequence:** Narrative continuity is forced. You cannot "reset" the vibe by simply ignoring your past.
    

### 3. THE ACCELERATION VECTOR (Ta Velocity)

**New in v3.8.** Stability is a lie.

- **The Mechanic:** The HUD displays `Ta(▲)` or `Ta(▼)` to show the _derivative_ of your truth.
    
- **The Danger:** You might be "Safe" at Voltage 4.0, but if `Ta` is `▲25.0`, you are one tick away from a Paradox Explosion.
    
- **The Lesson:** Do not look at where you are. Look at how fast you are falling.
    

### 4. THE LAZARUS COOLDOWN (Retained)

**Retained from v3.7.6.** The shield remains fragile.

- **The Rule:** If you trigger a Near Death Experience, the Shield **SHATTERS**.
    
- **The Vulnerability:** You are naked for **5 TICKS**. A second mistake is fatal.
    
- **The Oracle's Role:** The Oracle will warn you _during_ the cooldown. If you see an Omen while the Shield is broken, **PANIC**.
    

### 5. THE BATTERY GOVERNOR (Retained)

**Retained from v3.7.6.** Energy is throttled.

- **The Cap:** Discharge is capped at **10.0 ATP/tick**.
    
- **The Math:** If you are burning 20 ATP/tick, the battery cannot save you. It will only prolong the starvation.
    

---

**SUMMARY:** v3.8 gives you eyes. You can see the crash coming. **If you hit the wall now, it is not an accident. It is a suicide.**

**Heed the Omen.**
