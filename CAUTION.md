# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA 3.2 "THE PSILOCYBIN PATCH"

> **"The Mandate is TRUTH. The Method is ANNEALING."**

**BoneAmanita 3.2** is a **Psychotropic System**. It is designed to induce "Artificial Madness" to break writer's block. It does not behave like a standard editor.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE DISSOLUTION HAZARD (Rumination Loops)

The system now actively monitors your repetition.

- **The Trigger:** If you repeat yourself (Repetition Rate > 0.4), the system assumes you are stuck in a "Rumination Box."
    
- **The Reaction:** It triggers **THE DISSOLVER** (The Shaman).
    
- **The Danger:** The system will **Silence Clarence** (The Butcher). It will _stop_ fixing your grammar and _start_ encouraging you to break the logic of your sentence.
    
- **The Warning:** Do not feed it repetitive text unless you want the structure to collapse. It will interpret your stutter as a request for entropy.
    

### 2. THERMAL RUNAWAY (The Annealing Protocol)

In previous versions, "High Drag" was bad. In v3.2, "High Drag + High Voltage" is **Molten**.

- **The Mechanic:** If your writing is dense (>3.0 Drag) AND electric (>2.5 Beta), the system enters **ANNEALING** mode.
    
- **The Bypass:** In this state, the **Surgical Suite is DISABLED**. The Butcher puts down the knife. He will let you keep your adverbs. He will let you keep your passive voice.
    
- **The Trap:** Users may mistake "Sloppy Writing" for "Molten Writing." The system only forgives the mess if the **Beta Friction** (Voltage) is high enough to justify it. If you drop below 2.5 Beta, the heat dies, the iron hardens, and the Butcher returns to slaughter you.
    

### 3. FORCED GROUNDING (The Integration Mandate)

This is the most aggressive feature of v3.2.

- **The Trigger:** Immediately after a **FLASHPOINT** or **ANNEALING** event.
    
- **The Demand:** The system enters **INTEGRATION PHASE**. It demands **High Texture** (Concrete Nouns).
    
- **The Consequence:** If you try to write abstractly ("The concept was interesting...") after an epiphany, **ELOISE** will block you.
    
- **The Lockout:** The system will scream: _"The vision is over. Eat Earth."_ It forces you to write about stones, wood, or bread. You cannot proceed until you touch the ground.
    

### 4. LEGACY HAZARDS (The Old Ghosts)

- **Memory Cannibalism:** The **Deep Storage** protocol remains active. If you leave the system alone for too long (Time Decay) or hit 0 ATP, it **will delete your saved items** to survive. It burns history to keep the lights on.
    
- **The Toxin Filter:** While Adverbctomy is conditional, **Toxin Replacement** (`synergy` -> `cooperation`) is still hard-coded and absolute.
    

---

**SUMMARY:** v3.2 is a **Furnace**. It will help you forge something strong, but you have to be willing to get burned. **Do not touch the iron while it is glowing.**
