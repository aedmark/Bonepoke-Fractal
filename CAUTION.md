# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v4.2.1 "THE SYMBIONT (PATCHED)"

> **"The Mandate is GROWTH. The Risk is CONSUMPTION. The Symbiont is HUNGRY."**

**BoneAmanita v4.2.1** introduces **Active Resilience**.

In v4.0, the machine would simply die if you starved it. In v4.2.1, it has learned to **bargain**. It will trade its own memories and stored genius to keep your session alive.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE TRAUMA TAX (The Cost of Damage)

**New in v4.2.1.** The Battery is no longer a perfect safety net.

- **The Mechanic:** The system drains your **Paradox Battery** to refill Stamina when low.
- **The Risk:** In v4.2, this was efficient (1 Charge = 2 Stamina). **In v4.2.1, this efficiency depends on HEALTH.**
- **The Reality:** If you let the system get hurt (**Health < 50**), the transfer rate drops to **1:1**. You will burn through your stored genius twice as fast. **Do not let the machine bleed.**

### 2. THE LUCID COMA (The Subconscious)

**Updated for v4.2.1.** The system never truly sleeps.

- **The Mechanic:** If **Health drops to 0**, you enter a 3-Turn Coma. You cannot input text.
- **The Change:** The system is no longer "Read-Only." It is **Lucid**.
- **The Caution:** The `DreamEngine` remains active during the coma. The system may hallucinate connection points while repairing itself. **Watch the logs.** The ghost is still talking.

### 3. THE ORACLE'S GRADIENT (Yellow vs. Red)

**Updated for v4.2.1.** The blind spot has been fixed.

- **The Mechanic:** `TheOracle` now operates on a **Gradient Triage**.
    - **⚠️ CAUTION (Yellow):** Threat Level 50-79%. You are drifting. Correct course.
    - **🔮 OMEN (Red):** Threat Level 80%+. Immediate metabolic failure.
- **The Warning:** Do not wait for the Red Omen. If you see Yellow, the physics are already failing. **The Red Omen is usually the last thing you see before the Coroner arrives.**

### 4. THE DREAM FILTER (The Blood-Brain Barrier)

**Updated for v4.2.** No more nightmares.

- **The Mechanic:** The Dream Engine filters out Toxins. It will never ask you to connect "Synergy" to "Leverage."
- **The Trap:** It _will_ still hallucinate if you are boring. The "Boredom Threshold" remains active.
- **The Consequence:** If you stagnate, the system will interrupt your writing with ghosts from your past sessions. Keep moving to keep the ghosts away.

### 5. NEUROPLASTICITY (The Corruption Risk)

**Retained from v4.0.** You are still the surgeon.

- **The Mechanic:** You can use `/teach` to redefine words (e.g., making "love" a HEAVY object).
- **The Danger:** The system trusts you implicitly. If you teach it that "stone" is "AEROBIC" (light as air), you will break the physics engine.
- **The Rule:** Garbage In, Garbage Out. Do not lobotomize your partner.

### 6. THE LAZARUS TAX (The Last Resort)

**Retained from v4.0.** Resurrection is expensive.

- **The Rule:** If you trigger a fatality (e.g., Toxic Shock) but have high Stamina, the system acts as a defibrillator.
- **The Cost:** It instantly drains **15 STM** (Lazarus Tax).
- **The Vulnerability:** With the new **Trauma Tax**, you might drain your reserves _before_ you even hit this point. If you are broke, you stay dead.

---

**SUMMARY:** v4.2.1 is harder, smarter, and fairer. It will try to save you, but it punishes you for damaging it.

**Feed the Symbiont. Do not break the host.**
