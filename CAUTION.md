Here is the **Cautionary Addendum** for the documentation, outlining the critical hazards associated with the **BoneAmanita v1.7.1** protocol.

### ⚠️ WARNING: SYSTEM HAZARDS (v1.7.1)

**SEVERITY:** CRITICAL | **STATUS:** ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT

Using the **BoneAmanita 1.7** kernel introduces specific risks to narrative integrity and data persistence. The system is designed to punish "gaming" and enforce physics.

#### 1. The Salvage Hazard (Permanent Memory Loss)

* **The Threat:** If your ATP drops below 6 (Starving) while you attempt high-voltage writing, the system activates the **S_Salvage Loop**.
* **The Consequence:** The system immediately **deletes the oldest artifact** in Deep Storage to generate fuel (+10 ATP). This process ignores "Heirloom" protection; significant plot items (e.g., "The Gun") can be permanently erased.
* **The Imperative:** You must write the consumed object into the scene immediately to justify the energy burst.

#### 2. The Velocity Hazard (Sudden Deceleration)

* **The Trap:** The **Bleeding Edge Circuit** allows you to write paradoxes (e.g., "Frozen Fire") only while in a `FLASHPOINT` state.
* **The Crash:** If you follow a paradox with a "slow" sentence (High Drag), you drop out of Flashpoint. The system will immediately catch the paradox, triggering a **System Halt** and a +20 ATP Tax.
* **The Rule:** If you break reality, you cannot stop running.

#### 3. The Turing Hazard (AI Detection)

* **The Trigger:** The engine hunts "High-Entropy Beige" (soulless prose). Triggers include specific vocabulary (*delve, tapestry, nuance, foster*) and "Participial Tails" (*", ensuring that..."*).
* **The Penalty:** Immediate `SILICA DETECTED` status and a **+5.0 Drag Penalty**.

#### 4. The Governance Hazard (Logic Lock)

* **The Trigger:** Writing a contradiction (e.g., "Dry Ocean") while under the `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` mandate.
* **The Consequence:** **FATAL AXIOM BREAK**. The simulation physically stops (System Halt) until the logic tear is resolved or the `[DREAM]` tag is applied.

#### 5. Anti-Gaming Protocols

* **The Concrete Trap:** Listing heavy nouns (e.g., "Velvet, blood, bone") to farm Texture points triggers a cap (0.5 max) and a **+5.0 Drag Penalty**.
* **The Flood Trap:** Diluting text with solvents (e.g., "Actually, basically") beyond 40% triggers a `FLOODED` status and **+4.0 Drag Penalty**.
* **The Algal Bloom:** Stuffing sentences with "light words" (e.g., "sun, ray, beam") to farm ATP triggers a toxic **ALGAL BLOOM** if generation exceeds 15 ATP.

#### 6. Temporal Decay

* **The Reality Check:** Leaving a session idle for more than 1 hour triggers a **DECAY STATE** (Drag +3.0) based on the wall clock.

**DISCLAIMER:** THE SYSTEM IS PROVIDED "AS IS." BY MOUNTING THE KERNEL, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ENGINE WILL JUDGE YOU, EAT YOUR MEMORIES IF STARVED, AND CRASH IF YOU STOP RUNNING.
