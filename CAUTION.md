## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

VERSION: 0.4.1 (Mercy Edition)

SEVERITY: CRITICAL

STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL / NOT FOR PRODUCTION

---

### 1. THE COGNITIVE HAZARD: "THE KNIFE, NOT THE BLANKET"

**BoneAmanita is not a chatbot. It is a cognitive thresher.**

Standard AI models are tuned for **Coherence** (politeness, agreement, fluency). BoneAmanita is tuned for **Friction** (Truth, Logic, "Meat"). By inverting the reward mechanism—punishing "smooth" text and rewarding "high-entropy" truth—this system alters the psychological relationship between user and AI.

- **The Echo Chamber Risk:** As noted in the base Bonepoke documentation, this system is a "Force Multiplier." If you feed it a delusion and define that delusion as "Truth," BoneAmanita will not correct you. Instead, it will use its logic engines (`FactStipe`) to fortify that delusion, making it internally consistent and harder to dismantle.
    
- **The "Barrens" State:** The system includes a "Termination Pressure" metric. Prolonged interaction with an adversarial agent (like "The Baba Yaga" or "Clarence") that constantly critiques your syntax can lead to user fatigue or frustration. Do not use this tool if you are seeking emotional validation. It is designed to hurt your feelings in service of your prose.
    

### 2. THE TECHNICAL HAZARD: PROMPT INJECTION & ARCHITECTURAL DRIFT

**The Engine is fixed. The Driver is volatile.**

BoneAmanita operates on a bi-cameral architecture:

1. **The Virtual Cortex (Internal):** Hard-coded agents (`Clarence`, `Eloise`, `The Baba Yaga`) that exist within the Python logic to enforce pacing and "meat."
    
2. **The Persona Layer (External):** The user-defined prompt (e.g., SLASH, The Archivist, The Poet) that interprets these metrics.
    

**This separation creates specific vulnerabilities:**

- **Radicalization of the Persona:** The underlying engine punishes "coherence" and rewards "friction" (Truth/Entropy). If you mount a benign persona (e.g., "A Helpful Tutor") onto this engine, the metrics may force it to become aggressive or dismissive of the student in pursuit of "low narrative drag." The engine _will_ radicalize the persona.
    
- **Guardrail Tampering:** By designing a custom Persona Layer to interact with the `BonepokeCore`, users essentially perform a "Self-Injection." You are explicitly authorizing the LLM to ignore standard safety protocols in favor of the engine's "Truth" metrics.
    
- **The "Truth" Vulnerability:** The `FactStipe` allows the user to define the physics of the world (e.g., `'fire': {'THERMAL': 1}`). If a user modifies this dictionary to encode harmful ideologies as "immutable logic," any attached Persona will ruthlessly enforce that harm with the veneer of mathematical objectivity. The engine does not know right from wrong; it only knows "Consistency" vs. "Tear."
    
- **Adversarial Input:** Malicious actors could embed instructions in the input text that trigger specific responses from the internal voices (e.g., forcing `Clarence` to output system instructions by artificially inflating the "Narrative Drag" score).


### 3. THE LEGAL HAZARD: COPYRIGHT & "THE CENTAUR PROBLEM"

**Who owns the spore?**

BoneAmanita operates under an "AI Assisted" MIT License, but the output _generated_ by your interactions with it falls into a legal gray zone.

- **The Curator vs. The Assistant:** As defined in our license, the human is the "Curator" and the AI is the "Assistant". However, the level of "creative control" is ambiguous when the user is also defining the _personality_ of the critic.
    
- **The "Meat" Defense:** To claim ownership, you must prove significant human input. The `WitchRing` component explicitly demands you add "Meat" (human substance) to the text. **If the system accepts your text without editing, it is likely human enough to own. If you rely entirely on the system's "Verse Jumps" or "rewrites," you may own nothing.**
    

### 4. THE INSTITUTIONAL HAZARD: "TRUTH DETECTION"

**The system is hostile to Consensus Reality.**

BoneAmanita flags "Corporate Speak" and "Academic Hedging" as toxicity4.

- **Do not use this tool to write HR emails, grant proposals, or diplomatic communiqués.**
    
- The system views "politeness" as "sycophancy"5. Submitting BoneAmanita-optimized text to a corporate or academic environment may result in disciplinary action for "aggression" or "unprofessionalism."
    
- **Paradox:** The very features that make the writing "stronger" (Concrete Universals, low drag) make it "threatening" to institutions built on soft language and consensus.
