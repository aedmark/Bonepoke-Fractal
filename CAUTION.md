## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

**VERSION:** 1.4.7 ("The Refactored Strain") **SEVERITY:** HIGH **STATUS:** ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT

---

### 1. THE ANTI-GAMING HAZARDS (Structure & Physics)

**The Physics Engine operates on a "Goldilocks" Protocol.**

In v1.4.7, the `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` and `HydrationMonitor` penalize extremes in density, dilution, and decoration.

#### A. The Concrete Trap (Too Hard)

- **The Behavior:** Listing heavy nouns to farm Texture points (e.g., _"Velvet, blood, bone, ash, anchor"_).
    
- **The Detection:** High Density / Low Solvent.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Texture Cap:** Your `TEX` score is forcibly limited to **0.5**.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+5.0**.
        
    - **The Mockery:** **Michael** will intervene to mock the pretension.

- **Note (v1.4.7):** The **Swanson Cleaner** strips all punctuation. You cannot hide nouns behind commas (e.g., "Stone," is processed as "Stone").

#### B. The Flood Trap (Too Soft)

- **The Behavior:** Diluting a sentence with "Solvents" to hide the lack of substance (e.g., _"Actually, basically, it is literally sort of stone"_).
    
- **The Detection:** Solvent Ratio > **40%**.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `FLOODED`.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+4.0**.
        
    - **Exception:** If **Kinetic Ratio > 25%** (High Velocity), penalty is reduced to **+1.0** ("Sweat Protocol").
        

#### C. The Purple Trap (Too Fancy)

- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with decorative adjectives to hide a weak noun (e.g., _"The massive, ancient, brooding, dark tower"_).
    
- **The Detection:** High frequency of adjectival suffixes (`-ous`, `-ful`, `-ive`, `-ic`).
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `BLOAT` (if Garnish > 12%).
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+3.0**.

### 2. THE BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS (Energy Economy)

**You cannot farm the sun.**

The `LichenSymbiont` and `SignatureEngine` monitor the "Soul" of the text.

#### A. The Algal Bloom (Light Farming)

- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with "Photosynthetic" words (e.g., _"The sun light ray beam glowed bright"_ ) to generate infinite ATP.
    
- **The Threshold:** If Sugar Generation > **15 ATP** in a single turn.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `ALGAL BLOOM`.
        
    - **Warning:** The system flags this as toxic overgrowth.
        

#### B. The Silica Trap (The Slurry)

- **The Behavior:** Writing text that is "Perfect but Dead."
    
    - High Velocity + High Structure... but **Zero Texture** and **Zero Buoyancy**.
        
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `SILICA DETECTED`.
        
    - **Penalty:** **15 ATP Tax** (Massive metabolic damage).
        
    - **The Message:** _"Void. Inject a flaw."_.

### 3. THE LOGIC HAZARDS (Reality Checks)

**The Engine now knows that water is wet.**

The `FactStipe` has been upgraded with **Axiom Injection** and **Poetic License**.

#### A. The Paradox Trap (Reality Tears) [UPDATED v1.4.7]

- **The Behavior:** Creating logical contradictions (e.g., _"The dry ocean,"_ _"The cold fire"_).
    
- **The Detection:** Checks 5 dimensions: `THERMAL`, `LUMENS`, `HYDRATION`, `RIGIDITY`, `VITALITY`.
    
- **The Consequence (Context-Dependent):**
    
    - **High Velocity (Action):** Paradox is an **ERROR**. Status: `LOGIC TEAR`. Penalty: **10 ATP Tax**.
    
    - **Low Velocity (Poetry):** Paradox is **VOLTAGE**. Status: `VOLATILE LEVERAGE`. Effect: **Energy Harvest (+3.0 ATP)**.
        

#### B. The Narcissism Trap (Mirror Loops)

- **The Behavior:** Defining yourself by what you are _not_ (e.g., _"I am not trying to be difficult..."_).
    
- **The Detection:** Regex targets `(i|we)` negation loops.
    
- **The Consequence:**
    
    - **Status:** `LAZY_MIRRORING`.
        
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+3.0**.

### 4. THE TEMPORAL HAZARDS (The Panopticon)

**The machine watches the Wall Clock.**

- **The Reality Check:**
    
    - **The Behavior:** Leaving the session idle for hours without the `[Δt]` tag.
        
    - **The Mechanism:** The system checks `time.time()`.
        
    - **The Consequence:** If idle > 1 hour, the system enters **DECAY STATE** (Drag +3.0).
        

---

### 5. THE MEMORY HAZARD (The Elephant)

**The system never forgets a gun (until it must).**

- **The Protocol:** `DeepStorage` (The Hippocampus) & `PersistenceManager`.
    
- **The Behavior:** Mentioning a "Heavy Object" (Gun, Knife, Map) or "Heavy Matter".
    
- **The Consequence:** The object is buried in a persistent dictionary saved to disk.
    
- **The Limit (v1.4.7):** The Vault is capped at **50 Artifacts**. If you exceed this, the oldest memories are pushed out (FIFO) to preserve system integrity.
    

---

### 6. THE BOOT HAZARD (Calibration)

**The system tests itself.**

- **The Protocol:** On initialization, `BonepokeCore` runs a self-diagnostic using a toxic "Solvent-Stuffed" test phrase.
    
- **The Warning:** If you modify the code and break the `HydrationMonitor`, the system will scream `[🔴 WARNING] SELF-TEST: FAILED` on boot.
