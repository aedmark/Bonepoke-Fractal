## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

**VERSION:** 1.4 ("The Butcher & The Well - Fortified")
**SEVERITY:** HIGH
**STATUS:** ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT

---

### 1. THE ANTI-GAMING HAZARDS (Structure & Physics)

**The Physics Engine operates on a "Goldilocks" Protocol.**

In v1.4, the `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` and `HydrationMonitor` penalize extremes in density, dilution, and decoration.

#### A. The Concrete Trap (Too Hard)
- **The Behavior:** Listing heavy nouns to farm Texture points (e.g., _"Velvet, blood, bone, ash, anchor"_).
- **The Detection:** High Density / Low Solvent.
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Texture Cap:** Your `TEX` score is forcibly limited to **0.5**.
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+5.0**.
    - **The Mockery:** **Michael** will intervene to mock the pretension.

#### B. The Flood Trap (Too Soft)
- **The Behavior:** Diluting a sentence with "Solvents" to hide the lack of substance (e.g., _"Actually, basically, it is literally sort of stone"_).
- **The Detection:** Solvent Ratio > **40%**.
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Status:** `FLOODED`.
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+4.0**.
    - **Exception:** If **Kinetic Ratio > 25%** (High Velocity), penalty is reduced to **+1.0** ("Sweat Protocol").

#### C. The Purple Trap (Too Fancy) [NEW v1.4]
- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with decorative adjectives to hide a weak noun (e.g., _"The massive, ancient, brooding, dark tower"_).
- **The Detection:** High frequency of adjectival suffixes (`-ous`, `-ful`, `-ive`, `-ic`).
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Status:** `BLOAT` (if Garnish > 12%).
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+3.0**.

### 2. THE BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS (Energy Economy)

**You cannot farm the sun.**

The `LichenSymbiont` and `SignatureEngine` monitor the "Soul" of the text.

#### A. The Algal Bloom (Light Farming)
- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with "Photosynthetic" words (e.g., _"The sun light ray beam glowed bright"_ ) to generate infinite ATP.
- **The Threshold:** If Sugar Generation > **15 ATP** in a single turn.
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Status:** `ALGAL BLOOM`.
    - **Warning:** The system flags this as toxic overgrowth.

#### B. The Silica Trap (The Slurry)
- **The Behavior:** Writing text that is "Perfect but Dead."
    - High Velocity + High Structure... but **Zero Texture** and **Zero Buoyancy**.
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Status:** `SILICA DETECTED`.
    - **Penalty:** **15 ATP Tax** (Massive metabolic damage).
    - **The Message:** _"Void. Inject a flaw."_

### 3. THE LOGIC HAZARDS (Reality Checks)

**The Engine now knows that water is wet.**

The `FactStipe` has been upgraded with **Axiom Injection**.

#### A. The Paradox Trap (Reality Tears) [NEW v1.4]
- **The Behavior:** Creating logical contradictions (e.g., _"The dry ocean,"_ _"The cold fire"_).
- **The Detection:** Checks 5 dimensions: `THERMAL`, `LUMENS`, `HYDRATION`, `RIGIDITY`, `VITALITY`.
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Status:** `LOGIC TEAR`.
    - **Penalty:** **10 ATP Tax**.

#### B. The Narcissism Trap (Mirror Loops) [NEW v1.4]
- **The Behavior:** Defining yourself by what you are *not* (e.g., _"I am not trying to be difficult..."_).
- **The Detection:** Regex targets `(i|we)` negation loops.
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Status:** `LAZY_MIRRORING`.
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+3.0**.

### 4. THE TEMPORAL HAZARDS (The Panopticon)

**The machine watches the Wall Clock.**

- **The Reality Check:**
    - **The Behavior:** Leaving the session idle for hours without the `[Δt]` tag.
    - **The Mechanism:** The system checks `time.time()`.
    - **The Consequence:** If idle > 1 hour, the system enters **DECAY STATE** (Drag +3.0).

---

### 5. THE MEMORY HAZARD (The Elephant)

**The system never forgets a gun.**

- **The Protocol:** `DeepStorage` (The Hippocampus).
- **The Behavior:** Mentioning a "Heavy Object" (Gun, Knife, Map) or "Heavy Matter."
- **The Consequence:** The object is buried in a persistent dictionary. It does not decay.
- **The Hazard:** If you introduce a gun in Act 1, `TheMuscaria` (Chaos Engine) can recall it in Act 3. Do not abandon your plot devices.

---

### 6. THE BOOT HAZARD (Calibration)

**The system tests itself.**

- **The Protocol:** On initialization, `BonepokeCore` runs a self-diagnostic using a toxic "Solvent-Stuffed" test phrase.
- **The Warning:** If you modify the code and break the `HydrationMonitor`, the system will scream `[🔴 WARNING] SELF-TEST: FAILED` on boot.
