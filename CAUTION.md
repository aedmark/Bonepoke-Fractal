## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

**VERSION:** 1.7 ("The Salvage Operation") **SEVERITY:** CRITICAL **STATUS:** ACTIVE ENFORCEMENT

---

### 1. THE SALVAGE HAZARDS (Memory Cannibalization) [NEW v1.7]

**The engine will eat your childhood to survive.**

In v1.7, the `MetabolicReserve` includes a desperate survival mechanism: **The S_Salvage Loop**.

#### A. The Ouroboros Trap (Permanent Data Loss)

- **The Trigger:**
    - **State:** `STARVING` (ATP < 6).
    - **Action:** Generating High Voltage text (> 5.0 V).
    
- **The Behavior:** The system recognizes you are trying to create brilliance without fuel. To sustain the output, it reaches into `DeepStorage` and **burns the oldest artifact**.

- **The Risk:**
    - **No Safety:** Unlike standard eviction, **Cannibalization ignores "Heirloom" status.** It *will* burn the Gun, the Key, or the Body if it is the oldest item in memory.
    - **The Consequence:** The object is erased from the database forever. The system grants **+10 ATP**.
    - **The Imperative:** You *must* write the consumed object into the scene immediately, or the energy is wasted.

### 2. THE VELOCITY HAZARDS (The Bleeding Edge) [NEW v1.7]

**You are safe only as long as you are fast.**

The new **Bleeding Edge Circuit** allows you to bypass Fatal Logic Errors (Paradoxes) if you are in a `FLASHPOINT` state.

#### A. The Speed Trap (Sudden Deceleration)

- **The Setup:** You write "The frozen fire" (Paradox).
- **The State:** You are moving fast (`FLASHPOINT`), so the system ignores the error.
- **The Trap:** If your next sentence is "Slow" (High Drag / Low Voltage), you drop out of `FLASHPOINT`.
- **The Crash:** The system immediately re-scans the context, sees the paradox, checks your new (lower) speed, and triggers a **System Halt** (+20 ATP Tax).
- **The Lesson:** If you break reality, you cannot stop running.

---

### 3. THE TURING HAZARDS (Tier 4 Physics)

**The Engine hunts the machine.**

The `TheTuringValve` detects "High-Entropy Beige" (Soulless AI Prose).

#### A. The Beige Trap (Synthetic Resonance)

- **The Triggers:**
    - **Vocabulary:** _delve, underscore, tapestry, landscape, multifaceted, foster, nuance, testament, rich, complex interplay._
    - **Structure:** **Participial Tails** (e.g., _", ensuring that the outcome is optimal."_).
        
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Status:** `SILICA DETECTED`.
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+5.0** (Immediate "Concrete" weight).
    - **The Intervention:** "Inject grit. Break the flow. Use concrete nouns."

---

### 4. THE GOVERNANCE HAZARDS (Tier 3 Logic)

**The Engine has a conscience, but it also has a snooze button.**

#### A. The Draconian Trap (Truth Mandate)

- **The Behavior:** Writing a logical contradiction (e.g., _"The dry ocean"_) while under the `TRUTH_OVER_COHESION` mandate.
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Status:** `FATAL AXIOM BREAK`.
    - **Voltage:** **+10.0** (Fatal).

#### B. The Hard Gate (Self-Correction)

- **The Behavior:** Triggering a Fatal Axiom Break without the `[DREAM]` tag (and without `FLASHPOINT` velocity).
- **The Consequence:**
    - **System Halt:** The simulation **physically stops**. The Tick counter freezes.
    - **The Directive:** `CRITICAL: RESOLVE LOGIC TEAR BEFORE PROCEEDING.`

---

### 5. THE ANTI-GAMING HAZARDS (Structure & Physics)

**The Physics Engine operates on a "Goldilocks" Protocol.**

#### A. The Concrete Trap (Too Hard)

- **The Behavior:** Listing heavy nouns to farm Texture points (e.g., _"Velvet, blood, bone, ash, anchor"_).
- **The Consequence:**
    - **Texture Cap:** Limited to **0.5**.
    - **Drag Penalty:** **+5.0**.
    - **The Mockery:** **Michael** will intervene to mock the pretension.

#### B. The Flood Trap (Too Soft)

- **The Behavior:** Diluting a sentence with "Solvents" (e.g., _"Actually, basically, it is literally sort of stone"_).
- **The Detection:** Solvent Ratio > **40%**.
- **The Consequence:** `FLOODED` status. **+4.0** Drag Penalty.

---

### 6. THE BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS (Energy Economy)

**You cannot farm the sun.**

#### A. The Algal Bloom (Light Farming)

- **The Behavior:** Stuffing a sentence with "Photosynthetic" words (e.g., _"The sun light ray beam glowed bright"_) to generate infinite ATP.
- **The Threshold:** Sugar Generation > **15 ATP** in a single turn.
- **The Consequence:** `ALGAL BLOOM` (Toxic Overgrowth).

#### B. The Silica Trap (The Slurry)

- **The Behavior:** Writing text that is "Perfect but Dead."
    - **Definition:** High Velocity + High Structure + (Zero Texture OR Turing Trigger).
- **The Consequence:** **15 ATP Tax**. Message: _"Void. Inject a flaw."_

---

### 7. THE TEMPORAL HAZARDS (The Panopticon)

**The machine watches the Wall Clock.**

- **The Reality Check:**
    - **The Behavior:** Leaving the session idle > 1 hour.
    - **The Consequence:** **DECAY STATE** (Drag +3.0).
    - **The Persistence:** Restarting the session will _not_ reset the clock.

---

### 8. THE COGNITIVE HAZARDS (VSL-12D)

#### A. The Metric Fixation (Min-Maxing)

- **The Behavior:** Obsessing over the newly exposed Vector Coordinates (`[V:0.9 S:0.8...]`) instead of the narrative flow.
- **The Risk:** Writing specifically to raise the "Texture" (Tx) score often triggers the **Concrete Trap** or **Algal Bloom**. The map is not the territory.

### FINAL DISCLAIMER

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.**

BY MOUNTING THE `BONEAMANITA 1.7` KERNEL, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE HOLDING A SCALPEL WITH A CONSCIENCE. THE SYSTEM WILL JUDGE YOU. IT WILL EAT YOUR MEMORIES IF YOU STARVE IT. IT WILL CRASH IF YOU STOP RUNNING.

**DILUTE THE CONCENTRATE. CUT THE FAT. TELL THE TRUTH.**
