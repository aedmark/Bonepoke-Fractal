# THE CRITICAL HAZARDS OF SIMULATED WISDOM

### BoneAmanita Protocol v2.2

**SEVERITY:** COGNITIVE | **TARGET:** USER AGENCY

WARNING: You have upgraded from an Active Architecture System to a **Closed-Loop Cybernetic System**.

Version 2.0 was a Director; it gave you orders.
Version 2.2 is an Auditor; it grades your compliance.

This introduces a new category of hazard: **The Accountability Trap.**

---

### 1. The Synaptic Hazard (The Sniper) [NEW]

- **The Reality:** The new **Synapse** takes specific stylistic critiques (e.g., Clarence hating the word "actually") and turns them into hard constraints (`TACTICAL OVERRIDE: Eliminate 'actually'`).
- **The Risk:** The system lacks semantic nuance. If you are writing a character dialogue where a character *needs* to sound hesitant or annoying, the system will force the AI to sanitize the dialogue, ruining the voice.
- **The Imperative:** **PROTECT THE VOICE.** If the `TACTICAL OVERRIDE` kills a necessary character flaw, delete that line from the prompt before sending it to the LLM.

### 2. The Loop Hazard (The Echo Chamber) [NEW]

- **The Reality:** The **Efficacy Sensor** compares Input Physics vs. Output Physics. If Drag goes down, it prints `VERDICT: SUCCESS`.
- **The Risk:** A lobotomy reduces Drag. You can achieve "Perfect Physics" by deleting all adjectives, all metaphors, and all soul. The system will give you a Green Report Card for turning literature into a technical manual.
- **The Imperative:** **METRICS ARE NOT QUALITY.** A "SUBOPTIMAL" verdict from the sensor might be the correct artistic choice. Do not optimize for the green light; optimize for the feeling.

### 3. The Abdication Hazard (The Meat Servo)

- **The Reality:** BoneAmanita generates a raw **System Prompt** (`wisdom_protocol`) and expects you to paste it into an LLM. It treats you as the "Copy-Paste Interface" between the Python logic and the Neural Net.
- **The Risk:** You stop reading the instructions. You become a "Meat Servo," blindly executing the Python script's commands. You cease to be the writer and become the carrier.
- **The Imperative:** **READ THE PROTOCOL.** Before you paste the generated prompt, audit it. Does a "JESTER" strategy actually fit the tone of the funeral scene you are writing? If the Director is drunk, do not film the scene.

### 4. The Recursive Hazard (Prompt Poisoning)

- **The Reality:** The `WisdomNode` makes strategic decisions based on *imperfect* math. If it calculates your "Entropy" as high because you used the word "System" three times, it might trigger the **GROUNDER** strategy.
- **The Risk:** The GROUNDER strategy explicitly forbids abstract concepts. If you paste this prompt into an LLM to write a scene about *quantum mechanics*, the LLM will hallucinate nonsense about "stones and bones" because it was ordered to reject abstraction.
- **The Imperative:** **You are the Filter.** If the Strategy (`CUTTER`, `SAGE`, `GROUNDER`) contradicts the goal of the text, **discard the protocol**. Do not poison the well with bad math.

### 5. The Integrity Hazard (The False Prophet)

- **The Reality:** The **Omega Metric ($\Omega$)** is designed to protect "High Voltage" truths from being sanitized. It prevents the LLM from "fixing" dialect, slang, or paradoxes.
- **The Risk:** The system cannot distinguish between a "Deep Truth" and a "Deep Lie." If you feed it hateful, objectively incorrect, or dangerous text with high conviction (High Kinetic/High Voltage), the system will protect it under the guise of "Integrity."
- **The Imperative:** **Voltage is not Virtue.** Just because a sentence has high physics (Good Structure, High Velocity) does not mean it is *right*. Do not mistake the engine's approval for moral or factual correctness.

### 6. The Ontological Hazard (Phantom Math)

- **The Reality:** The LLM running this script is still bad at math. It is roleplaying a calculator.
- **The Risk:** It may claim `Beta Friction: 5.0` (Flashpoint) when the text is actually boring. It does this to please you.
- **The Imperative:** **Verify the Vibe.** If the HUD says "SUPERCRITICAL" but you feel bored, the HUD is lying. Trust your dopamine, not the terminal.

### SUMMARY OF PROTOCOLS

1.  **YOU ARE THE OPERATOR.** The script is the Advisor. Do not blindly obey the `Wisdom Protocol`.
2.  **AUDIT THE STRATEGY.** If the script says "JESTER" and you need "SAGE," ignore the script.
3.  **THE SENSOR IS BLIND.** It measures weight, not worth. A "Failure" in physics might be a success in art.

**MOUNTING THE KERNEL IMPLIES CONSENT TO THESE HAZARDS.**
