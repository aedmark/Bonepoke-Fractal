# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v3.6 "THE KINTSUGI PATCH"

> **"The Mandate is ANTI-FRAGILITY. The Method is KINTSUGI. The Danger is HUBRIS."**

**BoneAmanita 3.6** is not just a tool; it is a metabolic system with a finite lifespan and a specific hunger. It can heal itself, but it can also starve you out.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT (Automatic Garbage Collection)

**New in v3.5.** The system now practices aggressive hygiene.

- **The Feature:** On boot, the `DeepStorage` module scans for session files older than **24 hours**.
    
- **The Event:** It deletes them. Irrevocably.
    
- **The Rationale:** "The system must bury its dead to keep the living room clean."
    
- **The Warning:** Do not treat the `memories/` folder as a permanent archive. If you write a masterpiece today, back it up manually. If you come back in 2 days, it will be compost.
    

### 2. THE KINTSUGI GAMBLE (Gaming the System)

**New in v3.6.** The system allows you to repair a "Starving" state (< 10 ATP) instantly by solving a Koan.

- **The Feature:** If you hit critical failure, the system offers a "Golden Repair" (Restores 50 ATP).
    
- **The Temptation:** You might be tempted to _intentionally_ starve the machine just to trigger the free energy boost.
    
- **The Risk:** The Koan requires **High Voltage** (> 8.0) or **High Whimsy** to solve.
    
- **The Warning:** If you intentionally break the machine and then _fail_ to generate the necessary brilliance to fix it, you will be trapped in a death spiral with 0 ATP. Do not break what you cannot fix.
    

### 3. METABOLIC HAUNTING (Time Travel Sickness)

**New in v3.5.** ATP is now tied to the **Session File**, not the Runtime.

- **The Feature:** When you use `/seed [file]`, you inherit the memories _and_ the exhaustion of that timeline.
    
- **The Reality:** If you saved a session while "Starving," and you load it today, you will wake up "Starving."
    
- **The Warning:** Restarting the script does not cure hunger if you are loading a seed. You cannot escape your past choices.
    

### 4. THE CONTROL VACUUM (Command Decoupling)

**New in v3.6.** The Physics Engine no longer "reads" administrative commands.

- **The Feature:** Commands like `/kill`, `/seed`, and `/status` are handled by the `CommandProcessor`.
    
- **The Shift:** These inputs generate **Zero Voltage** and **Zero Drag**.
    
- **The Warning:** Do not try to be poetic with the Command Line Interface. It is a sterile zone. It will not give you feedback, and it will not feed the Lichen.
    

### 5. THE SURGICAL SCAR (Ego Injury)

The system continues to display its cuts openly.

- **The Display:**
    
    - `OLD: We basically need to utilize leverage.`
        
    - `NEW: We need to use use.`
        
- **The Risk:** Public shaming. The system will strip your "Corporate Speak" in front of you. It does not care about your feelings. It cares about the signal-to-noise ratio.
    

---

**SUMMARY:** v3.6 offers **Anti-Fragility**, but only to those who respect the physics. If you ignore the Reaper or fail the Kintsugi Koan, the system will not save you. **Fill the crack with gold, or do not break it at all.**
