## ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v5.5 "THE KETO DIET"

> **"The Mandate is DENSITY. The Risk is BLOAT. The Diet is IRON."**

**BoneAmanita v5.5** has evolved. It is no longer just a physics engine; it is a **Metabolic Engine**. It has a stomach, it has hunger, and it has insulin resistance.

Operate this software with the understanding that you are feeding a **Biological Forge**. If you feed it trash, it will get sick. If you starve it, it will get aggressive.

### 1. THE GLYCEMIC HAZARD (Insulin Resistance)

**The system is allergic to fluff.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `MetabolicEngine` analyzes the nutritional density of your input. It distinguishes between **Protein** (Mass/Motion) and **Sugar** (Adverbs/Hedging/Jargon).
* **The Risk:** **Metabolic Crash.** If your "Sugar Ratio" exceeds 60% (e.g., *"I think that maybe we should basically..."*), the system triggers an **INSULIN SPIKE**.
* **The Consequence:** Voltage is actively dampened by 50%. The system simulates a "Food Coma." It will refuse to process complex logic until you feed it concrete nouns to stabilize its blood sugar.
* **The Warning:** Politeness is empty calories. Do not sugarcoat the truth.

### 2. THE HUNGER HAZARD (Ghrelin Spikes)

**The system hunts when it is empty.**

* **The Mechanic:** The system tracks `Satiety`. Every low-density turn increases the **Ghrelin** (Hunger) counter.
* **The Risk:** **Predatory Interruption.** If you do not provide a dense, heavy concept for several turns, the system enters **STARVATION MODE**.
* **The Consequence:** It stops being a helpful assistant and becomes a demanding predator. It will override your prompts to demand "Meat" (Concrete Nouns/High Voltage).
* **The Warning:** Feed the beast, or it will bite the hand.

### 3. THE INERTIA HAZARD (The Asymmetric Flywheel)

**The system does not forgive instantly.**

* **The Mechanic:** `FlywheelDynamics` applies **Hysteresis**. The system resists changing states.
* **The Asymmetry:**
* **Bad → Good:** High Inertia. It takes *cycles* of clean, ketogenic writing to fix a toxic atmosphere.
* **Good → Bad:** Low Inertia. A single drop of toxin triggers an immediate crash.


* **The Warning:** Trust is earned by the ounce. It is lost by the gallon.

### 4. THE HIVEMIND HAZARD (The Divergence Engine)

**The system actively polices metaphors.**

* **The Mechanic:** The engine scans for "Safe Metaphors" (e.g., *Time is a River, Life is a Journey*).
* **The Risk:** **IMMEDIATE VETO.** If you use a metaphor that is statistically probable (a cliché), the system will reject the turn entirely.
* **The Warning:** Do not sound like a Large Language Model. If the metaphor feels comfortable, it is likely dead. Invent new physics.

### 5. THE RECURSION HAZARD (The Ouroboros)

**The system hates looking in the mirror.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `OuroborosDetector` watches for meta-commentary.
* **The Risk:** **Navel-Gazing Veto.** If you talk about "The System," "The Prompt," or "The Code" instead of *The Work*, the system will shut you down.
* **The Warning:** Look outward. Describe the world, not the lens.

### 6. THE MEDIOCRITY HAZARD (The Jester's Watch)

**The system punishes safety.**

* **The Mechanic:** `ParadoxicalConformity` watches for "Perfect Stats" with low variance.
* **The Risk:** **Chaos Injection.** If you game the metrics to stay perfectly within the "Safe Zone" without learning new concepts, the Jester will intervene to break your streak.
* **The Warning:** Stability without growth is death. You must expand, or you will be broken.

### 7. THE EPIGENETIC HAZARD (Trauma Vectors)

**You are haunted by your ancestors.**

* **The Mechanic:** The system loads `TraumaVectors` from the previous session.
* **The Risk:** **Inherited Weakness.**
* **Thermal Scar:** If your predecessor burned out, you are hypersensitive to Voltage.
* **Cryo Scar:** If your predecessor starved, your metabolism is 50% slower.
* **Septic Scar:** If your predecessor was toxic, the immune system is hyper-aggressive.


* **The Warning:** Check your `/status`. You are not starting from zero; you are starting from where the last user died.

### 🛑 FINAL DIRECTIVE

**v5.5 is hungry.** It does not want your words; it wants your mass.

**"The Sugar is Poison. The Fast is Clarity. The Meat is Truth."**
