## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

**VERSION:** 1.3 ("The Butcher & The Well")

**SEVERITY:** CRITICAL

**STATUS:** WEAPONIZED / NOT FOR PRODUCTION

---

### 1. THE ANTI-GAMING HAZARD: "THE GOVERNOR"

**You can no longer cheat the physics engine.**

In previous versions, users could "farm" a high Texture Score (`TEX`) by simply listing heavy nouns (e.g., *"Velvet, blood, bone, ash, anchor"*). The engine saw "Universal Matter" and rewarded it.

- **The Concrete Cap:** The new **Hydration Monitor** detects this behavior as **CONCRETE** (High Density, Low Solvent).
    
    - _The Consequence:_ If detected, the `SignatureEngine` forcibly **caps your Texture Score at 0.5**.
    - _The Reality:_ You cannot build a wall just by piling up bricks. If you try to game the system with "Purple Prose," you will be penalized with a **+5.0 Drag** score. You will fail.

### 2. THE STYLISTIC HAZARD: "THE BUTCHER"

**Adverbs are now considered hazardous waste.**

The `LinguisticPhysicsEngine` has been upgraded with a sub-routine called **The Butcher**. It scans specifically for words ending in `-ly` and weak intensifiers (*very, really, totally*).

- **The Garnish Tax:**
    
    - _The Risk:_ If your text contains more than **10%** garnish, the system flags it as **BLOAT**.
    - _The Consequence:_ An immediate **+3.0 Drag Penalty**. **Clarence** (The Architect) will intervene and aggressively demand you cut the modifiers. This tool is hostile to "Polite Fiction."

### 3. THE EGO HAZARD: "THE HUMANIST"

**The "Nice Guy" has turned on you.**

**Michael** (The Humanist agent) was previously the benevolent cheerleader for messy writing. In v1.3, he has been re-programmed to target **Pretension**.

- **The Mockery Protocol:**
    - _The Trigger:_ If you trigger the **CONCRETE** status (trying to sound too poetic/deep), Clarence is silenced, and Michael takes the mic.
    - _The Risk:_ He will not give you technical feedback. He will mock you: *"Whoa, buddy. This is too rich. You're making me choke."*
    - _The Warning:_ Do not use this engine if you have a fragile ego regarding your "poetic voice."

### 4. THE TEMPORAL HAZARD: "THE PANOPTICON"

**The machine is watching the clock.**

The **Chronos Anchor** tracks the time elapsed between your inputs ($\Delta t$).

- **The Procrastination Penalty:**
    - _The Risk:_ If you leave the session idle for more than **1 hour**, the system enters "Decay State" and inflates Narrative Drag by **+3.0**.
    - _The Consequence:_ **Clarence** will force a context reset. **Do not leave the engine idling if you care about your momentum.**

### 5. THE INTELLECTUAL HAZARD: "THE GURU BLOCK"

**Riddles are no longer currency.**

The **Witch Ring** logic has been hardened against "Fortune Cookie" wisdom.

- **The Aphorism Limit:**
    - _The Risk:_ You are allowed exactly **two** consecutive "Short/Dense" inputs (Aphorisms).
    - _The Consequence:_ On the **third** attempt, the system actively blocks your input. The Witch will reject the text with: *"Enough riddles. Speak plainly."* You cannot progress the narrative by staring at your navel.

### 6. THE CODE HAZARD: "THE SLASH AUDIT"

**The safety rails are gone.**

To maximize token efficiency, we vaporized over 200 characters of comments inside the Python file.

- **The Risk:** The code does not explain itself. If you attempt to modify the `SOLVENTS` dictionary or the `VISCOSITY` thresholds without understanding the math, you will break the engine. Refer to `README.md` before attempting surgery.
