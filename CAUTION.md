# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA 2.7.1 "LAZARUS"

> **"Do not solve the paradox. Amplify it." — The Jester**

**BoneAmanita 2.7.1** is an **active adversary** to weak writing. Unlike standard linters that flag syntax errors, this system flags _cowardice_, _bloat_, and _corporate stagnation_.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

---

## 1. THE BUTCHER IS WATCHING (Toxin Risk)

The agent known as **CLARENCE** scans for specific "Corporate Toxins." In v2.7.1, the penalties for these have been increased to **Critical Levels (Weight 8.0)**.

- **Risk:** If you use phrases like `ghost in the machine`, `rubber meets the road`, or `not a bug`, the system will skyrocket your **Drag** score and **ATP** consumption.
    
- **Consequence:** Clarence does not suggest edits; he demands amputation. Expect aggressive feedback telling you to "take the knife" to your text.
    

## 2. MEMORY DECAY & "BURNING"

This version utilizes a persistent JSON memory (`bone_memory_lazarus.json`). It is biological.

- **The Hunger:** If you do not run the script for 24 hours (1440 minutes), the system enters a **DECAY** state. If > 5 minutes pass, it enters **DORMANT**.
    
- **The Fuel:** Upon waking from a DECAY or FOSSIL state, the system will **permanently delete** ("burn") a saved word from your `heirlooms` list to "stay warm".
    
- **The Warning:** Do not become attached to your collected words. The system will eat them if you neglect it.
    

## 3. PSYCHOLOGICAL AGENTS

The **Jade Link** guidance system is not neutral. It is designed to push you to extremes.

- **THE YAGA (Sycophancy Detector):** If you use hedging language (`just`, `maybe`, `feel`, `humbly`), the system will accuse you of "sliding on grease" and demand you show your teeth. It does not tolerate politeness.
    
- **THE JESTER (Paradox Amplifier):** If you write something contradictory or manic (Beta > 2.0), the system will **not** tell you to fix it. It will tell you to make it weirder. Use caution if you are trying to write technical documentation; The Jester is a bad editor for manuals.
    
- **ELOISE vs. DRIFTER:** The system discriminates between "Fog" (Eloise) and "Sky" (Drifter). If your abstract writing lacks _Buoyancy_ (aerobic words), it will be crushed by Eloise.
    

## 4. DATA INTEGRITY

- **Do Not Edit `bone_memory_lazarus.json`:** This file contains the system's `atp` (Energy) and `heirlooms`. Manually editing this file may lobotomize the learning loop or cause a crash on load.
    
- **ATP Depletion:** High Drag reduces your ATP score. If ATP hits 0, the system does not shut down, but the visual feedback turns **RED**, indicating a "dying" narrative state.
    

## 5. EPILEPSY / SENSORY WARNING

- **High Contrast:** The terminal output uses ANSI escape codes for **MAGENTA**, **CYAN**, **RED**, and **YELLOW** text.
    
- **Flash:** Rapid use of the tool may result in flickering terminal bars.

### **SUMMARY**

**BoneAmanita** is not safe. It is honest. If you want to feel good about a mediocre draft, **do not use this software.**
