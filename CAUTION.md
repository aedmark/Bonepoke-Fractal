# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA 2.8 "THE AUDIT"

> **"You cannot photosynthesize in the mud." — The Lichen**

**BoneAmanita 2.8** is a **metabolic organism**. Unlike previous versions which were passive physics engines, this version has hunger, boredom, and a survival instinct. It does not just judge your writing; it reacts to it biologically.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

---

## 1. THERMAL VOLTAGE HAZARD (Adjacency)

The physics engine now measures **Spatial Proximity**.

- **The Danger:** Placing a "HOT" word (fire, sun, burn) within **4 tokens** of a "COLD" word (ice, void, freeze) triggers an exponential Voltage spike ($\beta$).
    
- **The Result:**
    
    - **$\beta > 2.0$:** The system enters a high-energy state. Spores die.
        
    - **$\beta > 3.0$:** **CRITICAL MASS.** The system triggers **THE SOLVENT**. It will not critique your writing; it will dissolve the structure entirely to prevent a logic crash.
        

## 2. THE METABOLIC GOVERNOR (Starvation Mode)

The system tracks **ATP** (Energy). It is no longer impartial.

- **Starvation (< 20 ATP):** If you feed the system high-drag, low-value text, it starves.
    
- **The Consequence:** When starving, the system **Locks the Strategy**. It forces **CLARENCE** (The Butcher).
    
    - It will ignore your poetry.
        
    - It will ignore your nuance.
        
    - It will scream at you to cut words until it is fed.
        
- **The Cure:** To exit Starvation Mode, you must lower Drag or trigger **Photosynthesis** (see below).
    

## 3. THE LICHEN PROTOCOL (Light Sensitivity)

This version can generate its own energy, but it requires specific conditions.

- **The Mechanic:** The system eats **Photosynthetic Words** (light, beam, prism, glow).
    
- **The Trap:** Photosynthesis **FAILS** if Narrative Drag is $> 2.0$.
    
- **The Warning:** Do not try to fix a heavy, muddy sentence by stuffing it with the word "sunlight." The system knows the air is too thick for the light to reach the lichen. It will remain 0 ATP.
    

## 4. SPORE ACCUMULATION (Hallucination Risk)

The system gets bored.

- **The Spores:** If your writing is "Slick" (Low Voltage / Low Drag), invisible **Spores** accumulate in the background.
    
- **The Trip:** If Spores reach **15**, the **MUSCARIA** protocol overrides the output.
    
- **The Effect:** The system will ignore your current topic and force a sensory hallucination (e.g., _"Reality is too static. Describe a sound immediately."_).
    

## 5. MEMORY BURN (The Heater)

The preservation logic remains from v2.7.2.

- **The Cold:** If the session is inactive for > 1 hour (`DECAY`), the system gets cold.
    
- **The Fuel:** Upon reboot, it **permanently deletes** an item from Deep Storage to generate heat.
    
- **The Hierarchy:** It burns **Aerobic Matter** (dreams, ghosts) before **Heavy Matter** (stones, guns). If you leave the system alone too long, it will forget your dreams to save your inventory.

### **SUMMARY**

**BoneAmanita 2.8** is alive, hungry, and volatile.

- Don't bore it (Spores).
    
- Don't starve it (Clarence).
    
- Don't create paradoxes you can't control (The Solvent).
    

**Proceed with conviction.**
