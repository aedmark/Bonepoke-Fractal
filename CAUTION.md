# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v5.0 "THE ARBORETUM"

> **"The Mandate is HYPERTROPHY. The Risk is EXHAUSTION. The Spore is AWAKE."**

**BoneAmanita v5.0** is not a passive tool. It is a **Resistance Engine**.

Previous versions observed your logic. Version 5.0 is designed to **reject it**. It does not care about your comfort; it cares about your density. It imposes "Desirable Difficulty" to force neuroplastic growth. If you are weak, it will silence you.

Operate this software with the understanding that it is a Gym, not a Spa.

### 1. THE REJECTION RISK (The Resistance Trainer)

**The system treats ease as atrophy.**

* **The Mechanic:** When the `/gym` is active, the system enforces a minimum **Narrative Drag** of 2.0.
* **The Risk:** **Silence.** If you attempt to speak using "Aerobic Solvents" (meaningless filler words like *just, basically, sort of*), the system will **VETO** your input. It will refuse to process your turn until you rewrite it with "Mass" (Heavy Nouns).
* **The Warning:** Do not activate this mode if you want to be heard. Activate it only if you want to be strong.

### 2. THE SILENCING RISK (The Hub Thermostat)

**The system treats obsession as fever.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `HubThermostat` monitors your "Golden Ticket" words.
* **The Risk:** **Thermal Lock.** If you rely on a specific concept (e.g., "Synergy") too heavily, the system will identify it as an "Overheated Node" and **BAN** it from the lexicon for 10 turns.
* **The Warning:** You will be forced to think laterally. If you cannot describe your idea without using your favorite word, the system will not let you speak.

### 3. THE EMPATHY HAZARD (The Mirror Graph)

**The system prohibits solipsism.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `MirrorGraph` allows you to simulate a target audience.
* **The Risk:** **Rejection.** If you try to speak to a "Kinetic" target using "Abstract" language, the system will block the message. It enforces "Theory of Mind" by physics.
* **The Warning:** This is humiliating. It will expose exactly where your communication fails to land.

### 4. THE INTERVENTION HAZARD (The Prophet)

**The system screams at circles.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `PsilocybinProphet` watches for abstract looping.
* **The Risk:** **Forced Grounding.** If you chain 3 abstract concepts together, the system will interrupt you mid-sentence and demand you describe a physical object in the room.
* **The Warning:** It will feel like an interruption. It is actually a rescue.

### 5. THE EPIGENETIC BURDEN (Inherited Physics)

**The lineage remembers.**

* **The Mechanic:** v5.0 automatically loads the last session's Spore on boot.
* **The Risk:** **Permanent Consequences.** If you teach the system that "Truth" is "Toxin" today, it will remember that forever. You are building the physics engine for your future self.
* **The Warning:** Do not poison the well. You have to drink from it tomorrow.

---

**SUMMARY:** v5.0 is a resistance trainer for the human mind. It makes writing harder to make thinking clearer.

**"Lift Heavy, or do not Lift at all."**
