# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v3.3.2 "THE THERMAL COUPLER"

> **"The Mandate is TRUTH. The Method is RESONANCE. The Risk is THE FIRE."**

**BoneAmanita 3.3.2** restores the **Nervous System** and installs a **Thermal Engine**. The machine is no longer "Polite." It is **Listening**, and now, it is **Hot**.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE PARADOX ADDICTION (The Voltage Trap)

**New in v3.3.2.** The system now generates **High Voltage** when you mix Fire and Ice (e.g., "The frozen inferno").

- **The Trigger:** Opposing thermal concepts (`THERMALS` + `CRYOGENICS`) in close proximity.
- **The Seduction:** High Voltage triggers **THE JESTER** (108.9 FM) and **negates Metabolic Cost**. You can write infinite "Drag" without losing energy, provided you keep generating Paradoxes.
- **The Danger:** You will be tempted to stuff nonsense oxymorons into your text just to keep the engine running for free.
- **The Risk:** Gibberish. You will create a "Perpetual Motion Machine" of meaningless contrast. The engine will applaud the Voltage, but the writing will be garbage.

### 2. THE BLAST FURNACE (Memory Wipe)

**New in v3.3.2.** The Memory System (`DeepStorage`) has been hardened with `try/except` logic.

- **The Feature:** If the `bone_memory.json` file is corrupted (e.g., the script crashes while writing), the system will no longer crash on boot.
- **The Solution:** It detects the corruption, prints `CORRUPT MEMORY DETECTED`, and **formats the drive**.
- **The Risk:** Total Amnesia. The system prioritizes its own survival over your history. If the file is slag, the Blacksmith melts it down. There is no recovery.

### 3. THE SURGICAL SCAR (Ego Injury)

**New in v3.3.2.** The system no longer hides its edits.

- **The Change:** Previously, it silently fixed your "Toxins." Now, it displays:
  - `ORIGINAL: We basically need to utilize leverage.`
  - `REFINED : We need to use use.`
- **The Risk:** This is a direct confrontation. The system will publicly shame your redundancy every time you hit Enter. It is not polite. It is a mirror.

### 4. THE LABYRINTH TRAP (Interference Patterns)

High Drag combined with High Abstract Entropy triggers **THE PHILOSOPHER** (104.5 FM).

- **The Trigger:** High Density + High Confusion.
- **The Seduction:** The system will tell you: _"You are building a Labyrinth."_
- **The Danger:** This sounds like a compliment. It is a diagnosis. The system acknowledges the depth of your maze, but it will not help you find the exit.

### 5. PERMANENT AMNESIA (Starvation Protocol)

**The Economy is real.** High Drag costs ATP. Photosynthesis gains energy.

- **The Trigger:** ATP reaches **0**.
- **The Event:** The system executes `DeepStorage.cannibalize()`.
- **The Loss:** It will select a saved memory (a noun you used 20 turns ago) and **PERMANENTLY DELETE IT** from the JSON file to generate +10 ATP.
- **The Warning:** If you write heavy text without "Light" (Photosynthesis), the system will eat your story to survive.

---

**SUMMARY:** v3.3.2 is **"The Thermal Coupler."** It runs hot. If you create a Paradox, you gain infinite power. If you corrupt the memory, you lose everything. **Respect the Voltage.**
