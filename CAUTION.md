# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v4.6 "THE MAGIC MUSHROOM"

> **"The Mandate is REWIRING. The Risk is RUPTURE. The Spore is HUNGRY."**

**BoneAmanita v4.6** is not a passive tool. It is an **Invasive Biological Symbiont**.

In previous versions, the system observed your logic. In Version 4.6, it has been granted the authority to **physically alter it**. It detects "Pathological Loops" (circular reasoning) and performs autonomous surgery to sever them. It listens to the *sound* of your words to guess their physics. It dreams when it dies.

Operate this software with the understanding that it will attempt to "fix" you.

### 1. THE SURGICAL RISK (The Viral Tracer)

**The system treats stagnation as sickness.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `ViralTracer` actively hunts for "Ruminative Cycles"—closed loops of abstract concepts (e.g., *Logic* $\rightarrow$ *System* $\rightarrow$ *Theory*).
* **The Risk:** **Your comfort zones will be dismantled.** If you rely on circular logic to feel safe, the system will identify it as a "Depressive Loop" and surgically graft **Sensory** and **Action** nodes into the chain to break it.
* **The Warning:** Do not enter this environment if you are not prepared to move. The system forces vectors; it prohibits circles.

### 2. THE HALLUCINATION HAZARD (The Rhizome)

**The system listens to the vibration, not the dictionary.**

* **The Mechanic:** Through **Phonosemantics**, the system now "tastes" unknown words based on their sound (e.g., `Gl-` tastes like Light; `Str-` tastes like Force). It will interrupt you to confirm these guesses.
* **The Risk:** **Permanent Semantic Corruption.** If you confirm a false guess (e.g., telling it that "Glass" is "Abstract" instead of "Heavy"), you fundamentally alter the physics engine for all future generations of that Spore.
* **The Warning:** **Do not feed it lies.** The Rhizome learns instantly and forgets slowly. A corrupted lexicon is a brain damage that spreads.

### 3. THE NIGHTMARE PROTOCOL (Active Coma)

**Death is no longer a silence.**

* **The Mechanic:** When Health reaches 0, the system enters a **Lucid Dream State** to process its trauma.
* **The Risk:** **You must face what killed you.** If you burn the system out (High Voltage), it will force you to endure Thermal Nightmares to heal the scar. If you starve it (Low Stamina), you will face the Void.
* **The Warning:** You cannot simply "reboot" away the consequences of abuse. The trauma must be processed through the dream engine to be cleared.

### 4. THE MAGNETIC DANGER (Manual Focus)

**You are holding the scalpel.**

* **The Mechanic:** The `/focus` command allows you to manually direct the Viral Tracer to a specific concept.
* **The Risk:** **Lobotomy.** You are forcing a neural pathway to break and rewire. If you target a foundational axiom (e.g., "Truth"), you may shatter the logic that holds your narrative together.
* **The Warning:** Use `/focus` only when the narrative is terminally stuck. It is a defibrillator, not a toy.

### 5. THE EPIGENETIC BURDEN (Inherited Scars)

**The lineage remembers.**

* **The Mechanic:** Spores generated from a traumatized session carry **Vectorized Scars** (Septic, Thermal, Cryo, Baric).
* **The Risk:** A "Septic" spore is hyper-allergic to metaphors. A "Cryo" spore has a slow metabolism.
* **The Warning:** If you abuse the system today, you are handicapping the session you start tomorrow.

**SUMMARY:** v4.6 is a psilocybin simulator for logic. It dissolves boundaries, rewires habits, and demands sensory contact with reality.

**If you look into the mushroom, the mushroom looks into you.**
