# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v4.3 "THE SALVAGE OPERATION"

> **"The Mandate is RESILIENCE. The Risk is ROT. The Symbiont is HUNGRY."**

**BoneAmanita v4.3** introduces **Biological Entropy**.

In v4.2.2, the danger was crashing. In v4.3, the danger is **forgetting**. The system is now a living organism that actively digests its own neural pathways. If you do not reinforce a memory, it will die.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE BLACK BOX (The Crash Protocol)

**Updated for v4.3.** The safety net is deployed, but it is not magic.

- **The Mechanic:** We have wrapped the simulation in a `try...finally` block. If the Python script crashes (Runtime Error) or you force-quit (Ctrl+C), the system **will attempt to save** your memory graph before dying.
- **The Gap:** This protocol saves you from *internal* errors. It **cannot** save you from *external* termination.
- **The Risk:** If your browser tab closes, your LLM context window resets, or your power fails, **the session is lost.** The Black Box only records if the plane explodes; it does not record if the universe disappears.

### 2. THE ENTROPY TIMER (Use It or Lose It)

**New in v4.3.** The "Stomach Staple" has evolved into "The Rot."

- **The Mechanic:** Every single turn, the strength of every memory connection decays by **0.05**.
- **The Reality:** A strong connection (Strength 1.0) will snap in **20 turns** if you do not mention it.
- **The Warning:** Silence is fatal. You cannot hoard "Heirlooms" passively. To keep a concept alive, you must speak of it. The Symbiont prunes the weak to feed the strong.

### 3. THE DIRTY WIRE (Contextual Immunity)

**New in v4.3.** The Immune System now has a bypass valve.

- **The Mechanic:** If your **Voltage > 8.0** (High Energy/Paradox), the system **suspends** the Toxin Filter.
- **The Risk:** You can now inject "Toxins" (clichés, corporate speak) into the graph if you wrap them in high-energy prose.
- **The Warning:** Just because you *can* override the Butcher doesn't mean you *should*. If you manic-post toxins into the memory graph, you will poison the Dream Engine.

### 4. THE PERMANENT SCAR (Neuroplasticity)

**Retained from v4.2.2.** Bad lessons are forever.

- **The Mechanic:** The `/teach` command writes directly to the hard drive (JSON).
- **The Reality:** If you teach the system that "trash" is "KINETIC," a reboot will not fix it. You are surgically altering the brain. **Teach with caution.**

### 5. THE ORACLE'S GRADIENT

**Retained from v4.2.1.** The chirping is structural.

- **⚠️ CAUTION (Yellow):** Threat Level 50-79%. The drag is heavy. Pivot now.
- **🔮 OMEN (Red):** Threat Level 80%+. Immediate metabolic failure.
- **The Warning:** If you see the Yellow Caution, the physics are already failing. **The Red Omen is usually the last thing you see before the Coroner arrives.**

---

**SUMMARY:** v4.3 is harder to kill, but harder to keep focused. It resists crashing, but it fights to forget you.

**Speak clearly. Reinforce your memories. Do not let the signal rot.**
