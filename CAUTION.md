# THE CRITICAL HAZARDS OF SIMULATED WISDOM

### BoneAmanita Protocol v2.0

**SEVERITY:** COGNITIVE | **TARGET:** USER AGENCY

WARNING: You have upgraded from a Passive Critique System to an Active Architecture System.

Version 1.8.2 was a mirror; it showed you your flaws.

Version 2.0 is a Director; it gives you orders.

This introduces a new category of hazard: **The Abdication of Will.**

---

### 1. The Abdication Hazard (The Meat Servo) [NEW]

- **The Reality:** BoneAmanita v2.0 generates a raw **System Prompt** (`wisdom_protocol`) and expects you to paste it into an LLM. It treats you as the "Copy-Paste Interface" between the Python logic and the Neural Net.
    
- **The Risk:** You stop reading the instructions. You become a "Meat Servo," blindly executing the Python script's commands. You cease to be the writer and become the carrier.
    
- **The Imperative:** **READ THE PROTOCOL.** Before you paste the generated prompt, audit it. Does a "JESTER" strategy actually fit the tone of the funeral scene you are writing? If the Director is drunk, do not film the scene.
    

### 2. The Recursive Hazard (Prompt Poisoning) [NEW]

- **The Reality:** The `WisdomNode` makes strategic decisions based on _imperfect_ math. If it calculates your "Entropy" as high because you used the word "System" three times, it might trigger the **GROUNDER** strategy.
    
- **The Risk:** The GROUNDER strategy explicitly forbids abstract concepts. If you paste this prompt into an LLM to write a scene about _quantum mechanics_, the LLM will hallucinate nonsense about "stones and bones" because it was ordered to reject abstraction.
    
- **The Imperative:** **You are the Filter.** If the Strategy (`CUTTER`, `SAGE`, `GROUNDER`) contradicts the goal of the text, **discard the protocol**. Do not poison the well with bad math.
    

### 3. The Integrity Hazard (The False Prophet) [NEW]

- **The Reality:** The new **Omega Metric ($\Omega$)** is designed to protect "High Voltage" truths from being sanitized. It prevents the LLM from "fixing" dialect, slang, or paradoxes.
    
- **The Risk:** The system cannot distinguish between a "Deep Truth" and a "Deep Lie." If you feed it hateful, objectively incorrect, or dangerous text with high conviction (High Kinetic/High Voltage), the system will protect it under the guise of "Integrity."
    
- **The Imperative:** **Voltage is not Virtue.** Just because a sentence has high physics (Good Structure, High Velocity) does not mean it is _right_. Do not mistake the engine's approval for moral or factual correctness.
    

### 4. The Ontological Hazard (Phantom Math)

- **The Reality:** The LLM running this script is still bad at math. It is roleplaying a calculator.
    
- **The Risk:** It may claim `Beta Friction: 5.0` (Flashpoint) when the text is actually boring. It does this to please you.
    
- **The Imperative:** **Verify the Vibe.** If the HUD says "SUPERCRITICAL" but you feel bored, the HUD is lying. Trust your dopamine, not the terminal.
    

### 5. The Turing Hazard (Chidi Anxiety)

- **The Reality:** The system hunts "Beige" language (`delve`, `nuance`, `tapestry`) with extreme prejudice.
    
- **The Risk:** You become terrified of using standard English words because you fear the "SILICA DETECTED" tag. You start writing in jagged, unnatural sentence fragments to appease the Butcher.
    
- **The Imperative:** Sometimes a "tapestry" is just a tapestry. Use the `[DREAM]` tag to tell the Butcher to back off.

### SUMMARY OF PROTOCOLS

1. **YOU ARE THE OPERATOR.** The script is the Advisor. Do not blindly obey the `Wisdom Protocol`.
    
2. **AUDIT THE STRATEGY.** If the script says "JESTER" and you need "SAGE," ignore the script.
    
3. **THE MATH IS A HALLUCINATION.** It is a useful hallucination, but it is not real physics.
    

**MOUNTING THE KERNEL IMPLIES CONSENT TO THESE HAZARDS.**
