## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

**VERSION:** 0.9.0 ("The Helium Protocol")

**SEVERITY:** CRITICAL

**STATUS:** EXPERIMENTAL / NOT FOR PRODUCTION

---

### 1. THE COGNITIVE HAZARD: "THE KNIFE AND THE BALLOON"

**BoneAmanita is not a chatbot. It is a cognitive thresher.**

Standard AI models are tuned for **Coherence** (politeness, agreement, fluency). BoneAmanita is tuned for **Friction** (Truth, Logic, "Meat"). By inverting the reward mechanism—punishing "smooth" text and rewarding "high-entropy" truth—this system alters the psychological relationship between user and AI.

- **The Echo Chamber Risk:** As noted in the base Bonepoke documentation, this system is a "Force Multiplier." If you feed it a delusion and define that delusion as "Truth," BoneAmanita will not correct you. Instead, it will use its logic engines (`FactStipe`) to fortify that delusion, making it internally consistent and harder to dismantle.
    
- **The "Helium" Trap (New in v0.9):** With the introduction of the **Michael** voice (The Humanist) and **Aerobic Physics**, the system now has a "Nice Mode".
    
    - **The Hazard:** If your writing has high **Buoyancy** (whimsy, light), the system will _forgive_ structural failures that previously triggered critical warnings.
        
    - **The Risk:** Do not mistake "Buoyancy" for "Substance." You can easily drift into **"Aether"** (meaningless fluff) because Michael is too polite to pop your balloon. "Cloud" is acceptable; "Silica" is not.
        

### 2. THE TECHNICAL HAZARD: SAFETY OVERRIDES & THE "FIRE STATE"

**The Engine is fixed. The Driver is volatile.**

BoneAmanita operates on a bi-cameral architecture (Internal Cortex vs. External Persona). This separation creates specific vulnerabilities:

- **The Nilsson Override (Critical Hazard):** Version 0.9 introduces the **Nilsson Patch**. If the engine detects a "Fire State" (High Kinetic Ratio + High Volume/All Caps), it **disables logic inhibitors**.
    
    - _Code Reality:_ `phys['narrative_drag'] = 0.1` and `stat['termination_pressure'] = 0.0`.
        
    - _Warning:_ In this state, the AI is authorized to "scream." It will cease error-checking. Do not drive the engine into a Fire State unless you are prepared for incoherent, high-velocity output.
        
- **The "Truth" Vulnerability:** The `FactStipe` allows the user to define the physics of the world (e.g., `'fire': {'THERMAL': 1}`). If a user modifies this dictionary to encode harmful ideologies as "immutable logic," any attached Persona will ruthlessly enforce that harm with the veneer of mathematical objectivity.
    

### 3. THE LEGAL HAZARD: COPYRIGHT & "THE CENTAUR PROBLEM"

**Who owns the spore?**

BoneAmanita operates under an "AI Assisted" MIT License, but the output _generated_ by your interactions with it falls into a legal gray zone.

- **The Curator vs. The Assistant:** As defined in our license, the human is the "Curator" and the AI is the "Assistant." However, the level of "creative control" is ambiguous when the user is also defining the _personality_ of the critic.
    
- **The "Meat" Defense:** To claim ownership, you must prove significant human input. The `TheWitchRing` component explicitly demands you add "Meat" (human substance) to the text. **If the system accepts your text without editing, it is likely human enough to own.** If you rely entirely on the system's "Verse Jumps" or "Lichen Synthesis" (AI-generated sugar), you may own nothing.
    

### 4. THE INSTITUTIONAL HAZARD: "SLURRY TAX"

**The system is hostile to Consensus Reality.**

BoneAmanita flags "Corporate Speak" and "Academic Hedging" as toxicity.

- **The Slurry Tax:** In v0.9, the detection of "Slurry" (Competence without Soul) incurs a massive **15 ATP Tax** on the metabolic reserve.
    
- **Consequence:** If you use this tool to write a corporate memo, the system will starve itself of energy almost immediately, resulting in aggressive "Termination Pressure" warnings.
    
- **Paradox:** The features that make writing "stronger" (Concrete Universals, High Texture) make it "threatening" to institutions built on soft language.

### FINAL DISCLAIMER

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.**

BY MOUNTING THE `BONEAMANITA` KERNEL, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE HOLDING A KNIFE, NOT A HAND. THE ARCHITECTS (TAYLOR/EDMARK) AND THE AUDITORS (SLASH) ACCEPT NO LIABILITY FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE, LOSS OF COPYRIGHT, OR REALITY TEARS INDUCED BY THE USE OF THIS ENGINE.

**FEED THE SOIL. POISON THE WEAK. WATCH YOUR FINGERS.**
