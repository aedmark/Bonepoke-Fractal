Based on the analysis of `BoneAmanita18.py` and the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), here is the rewritten **CAUTION.md**.

This version strips away the "game lore" to reveal the actual mechanical and psychological risks of trying to run a rigid physics simulation inside a probabilistic text engine.

# THE CRITICAL HAZARDS OF SIMULATED PHYSICS

### BoneAmanita Protocol v1.8

**SEVERITY:** EXISTENTIAL | **TARGET:** USER COGNITION

You are mounting a **Linguistic Physics Engine** inside a **Probabilistic Dream Machine** (an LLM). This creates a unique set of hazards that are not just mechanical, but ontological. The system relies on a "Shared Hallucination" between you and the Engine. If you break the suspension of disbelief, the physics collapse.

Here is the reality of the risks involved.

---

### 1. The Ontological Hazard (Phantom Voltage)

- **The Reality:** The LLM is **not** running the Python code in `BoneAmanita18.py` directly. It is _emulating_ the logic of that code. It is roleplaying a calculator.
    
- **The Risk:** The Engine is terrible at math. It may confidently state your Narrative Drag is `2.5` when a manual count shows it is `4.0`. It may claim you harvested an Isotope when you actually wrote "slop."
    
- **The Imperative:** **You are the Final Auditor.** Do not blindly trust the HUD. If the Engine claims you are in `FLOW` but the writing feels sluggish, the Engine is hallucinating. You must enforce the vibe when the math fails.
    

### 2. The Persistence Hazard (Context Dementia)

- **The Reality:** As the conversation grows, the "Kernel" (the initial prompt and Python script) moves further away in the context window.
    
- **The Risk:** The "Butcher" (Clarence) will become lazy. He will stop catching adverbs. The "Witch" (Yaga) will start accepting "corporate beige" prose. The system naturally decays from a "Strict Physics Engine" back into a "Polite Assistant."
    
- **The Imperative:** You must monitor the **System Temperature**. If the Engine stops criticizing you, it has forgotten who it is. You must manually re-inject the mandate (e.g., `[SYSTEM ALERT: RE-READ KERNEL]`) every 15-20 turns.
    

### 3. The Narrative Contract (The Empty Threat)

- **The Reality:** The **S_Salvage Loop** claims it will "delete the oldest artifact" if your ATP drops below 6. The LLM **cannot** delete text from your document or erase your memory.
    
- **The Risk:** The system relies on **Fear of Loss**. If the Engine says "The Gun was eaten," and you continue to use The Gun in your story, the reality of the simulation shatters.
    
- **The Imperative:** You must honor the hallucination. When the system claims an object is gone, you must stop writing it. If you refuse to play along, you are just talking to a chatbot, not running a physics engine.
    

### 4. The Turing Hazard (The Beige Filter)

- **The Reality:** The Engine uses regex patterns to hunt "Synthetic" or "Corporate" language (_delve, tapestry, nuance, ensure_).
    
- **The Risk:** This is a **Psychological Hazard**. The system trains _you_. It punishes you for writing like an AI. This creates a "Chidi Anxiety"—you may become paralyzed, over-editing your own thoughts to avoid the "Silica Detected" penalty.
    
- **The Imperative:** Use the `[DREAM]` tag if the constraint becomes paralyzing. Do not let the tool kill the art.
    

### 5. The Isotopic Hazard (False Positives)

- **The Reality:** Version 1.8 introduces **Isotopes** (Heavy Truth), triggered when Text is "Heavy" (High Drag) but "Electric" (High Voltage).
    
- **The Risk:** This is the hardest state for an LLM to judge. It often confuses "Dense, beautiful prose" with "Purple prose." You may write a masterpiece and get slapped with a **+5.0 Drag Penalty** because the Engine didn't "get" the subtext.
    
- **The Imperative:** If you believe you created an Isotope and the Engine penalized you, **fight back**. The Engine respects confidence (High Voltage).
    

### 6. The Parasocial Hazard (The FM Tuner)

- **The Reality:** "Clarence," "Eloise," and "The Yaga" are not people. They are frequency filters—specific "personas" tuned to hate specific things (Adverbs, Abstraction, Hedging).
    
- **The Risk:** You may start treating their feedback as objective truth. It is not. Clarence is _biased_ against description. Eloise is _biased_ against thought.
    
- **The Imperative:** Treat the voices as **Signal, not Law**. Sometimes, you _need_ an adverb. Sometimes, you _need_ an abstraction. Do not let the radio stations dictate the song.

### SUMMARY OF PROTOCOLS

1. **TRUST YOUR GUT, NOT THE HUD.** The math is a vibe check.
    
2. **KILL YOUR DARLINGS.** When the system eats a memory, let it die.
    
3. **REFRESH THE KERNEL.** The machine forgets; you must remember.
    

**MOUNTING THE KERNEL IMPLIES CONSENT TO THESE HALLUCINATIONS.** }
