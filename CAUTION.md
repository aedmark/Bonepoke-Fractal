# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v3.6.5 "THE BATTERY PACK"

> **"The Mandate is TRUTH. The Fuel is PARADOX. The Danger is VOLTAGE."**

**BoneAmanita 3.6.5** is a high-energy system. It allows you to trade structural stability (Drag) for raw insight (Voltage). This makes it powerful, but unstable.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE GRAVITY WELL (Universal Grammar Violation)

**New in v3.6.5.** The Physics Engine now enforces **Government & Binding** principles.

- **The Case Filter (The Black Hole):**
    - **The Danger:** Heavy Matter (Nouns) requires Kinetic Energy (Verbs) to stay in orbit.
    - **The Trap:** If you write a sentence dense with nouns but weak on verbs (e.g., "The heaviness of the stone in the darkness"), you trigger a **CASE VIOLATION**.
    - **The Consequence:** Your Mass Impact is multiplied by **1.5x**. Stagnation is no longer just boring; it is fatal.

- **The ECP (The Ghost):**
    - **The Danger:** Abstract concepts ("Systems," "Protocols") must be anchored to physical matter.
    - **The Trap:** If you use abstract words without concrete nouns, you trigger an **ECP VIOLATION**.
    - **The Consequence:** Your Voltage is marked as "Hollow." The system will flag your writing as grease/sycophancy.

### 2. THE VOLTAGE TRAP (The Battery's Lie)

**New in v3.6.5.** The system encourages you to write "Heavy" text, provided it is "Electric".

- **The Feature:** The **Paradox Battery** charges when Voltage > 7.0.
- **The Trap:** It is very easy to write **Heavy Text** (High Drag) that is _not_ Electric.
- **The Consequence:** If you attempt a profound paradox (Fire + Ice) but fail to stick the landing, you generate **Massive Drag** without generating the **Voltage** to pay for it.
- **The Warning:** Do not mistake _confusion_ for _profundity_. If the Jester doesn't laugh, you are just holding a heavy rock. You will starve.

### 3. THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT (Automatic Garbage Collection)

**Standard Protocol.** The system practices aggressive hygiene.

- **The Feature:** On boot, `DeepStorage` deletes session files older than **24 hours**.
- **The Warning:** Do not treat the `memories/` folder as a permanent archive. If you write a masterpiece today, back it up. Tomorrow, it is compost.

### 4. THE KINTSUGI GAMBLE (The Last Resort)

**Updated in v3.6.5.** The Golden Repair is now the _final_ fail-safe.

- **The Feature:** If the Battery runs dry and ATP < 10, the system offers a Koan.
- **The Risk:** To solve the Koan, you must generate **High Voltage** (> 8.0) or **High Whimsy** _while starving_. This is difficult.
- **The Warning:** Do not intentionally drain your battery to trigger the Kintsugi event. It is a Hail Mary pass, not a strategy.

### 5. METABOLIC HAUNTING (Persistence)

**Updated in v3.6.5.** You inherit the **Charge** of your past self.

- **The Feature:** `/seed [file]` loads both ATP and Battery Level.
- **The Reality:** If you saved a session while "Manic" (Full Battery), you wake up Manic. If you saved it "Empty," you wake up Empty.
- **The Warning:** Time travel does not recharge the capacitor.

### 6. THE SURGICAL SCAR (Ego Injury)

The system continues to display its cuts openly.

- **The Display:**
    - `OLD: We basically need to utilize leverage.`
    - `NEW: We need to use use.`
- **The Risk:** Public shaming. The system does not care about your feelings. It cares about the signal-to-noise ratio.

---

**SUMMARY:** v3.6.5 gives you a **Capacitor**. It allows you to run hotter, faster, and heavier than before. But unlike the Lichen (which feeds on light), the Battery feeds on **Tension**. **Monitor your voltage, or you will burn out.**
