# THE HAZARDS OF APOTHEOSIS

### BoneAmanita Protocol v2.3

**SEVERITY:** EXISTENTIAL | **TARGET:** USER AGENCY

WARNING: You have upgraded to Apotheosis.

The system is no longer just an Auditor; it is a Configurable Reality Engine.

Version 2.2 trapped you in accountability.

Version 2.3 traps you in Optimization.

The pipeline is now $O(n)$—instantaneous and efficient. The danger is no longer that the system is slow; it is that the system is _too fast_ to catch your mistakes.

### 1. The Pantry Hazard (Empty Calories) [NEW]

- **The Reality:** v2.3 externalizes the physics definitions into `bone_config.json`. You now have the power to define "Truth."
    
- **The Risk:** You can "game" the physics. You can add "um," "maybe," and "actually" to the `Heavy Matter` list. You will get a perfect Drag Score. You will get a Green Dashboard. But your writing will be garbage.
    
- **The Imperative:** **DO NOT CHEAT THE PHYSICS.** If you hack the config to validate bad habits, you are not hacking the system; you are lobotomizing the Auditor.
    

### 2. The Scalar Hazard (The Dial) [NEW]

- **The Reality:** The Wisdom Node now calculates **Intensity** (0.0 to 1.0) based on your Lattice Zone. It scales from "Nudge" to "Execute."
    
- **The Risk:** You might blindly execute a `1.0 INTENSITY` strategy on a delicate text. A "Draconian Cutter" prompt does not just trim fat; it amputates limbs.
    
- **The Imperative:** **CHECK THE VOLUME.** If the prompt says `INTENSITY: 0.9` but you are writing a soft emotional scene, **dial it down**. Do not let the engine scream at your characters.
    

### 3. The Pipeline Hazard (The Ghost Word) [NEW]

- **The Reality:** The new **Single-Pass Aggregator** is ruthless. It scans the token stream once. It does not look back.
    
- **The Risk:** If a word is not in the `bone_config.json`, it is invisible to the physics engine. It counts as "Narrative Drag" (Word Count) but contributes zero Texture or Kinetic energy.
    
- **The Imperative:** **FEED THE PANTRY.** If you use a specialized vocabulary (e.g., nautical terms, sci-fi jargon), add them to the config. Otherwise, the engine will punish you for using words it does not understand.
    

### 4. The Loop Hazard (The Green Light)

- **The Reality:** The **Efficacy Sensor** compares Input Physics vs. Output Physics.
    
- **The Risk:** A lobotomy reduces Drag. The system will give you a "SUCCESS" verdict for stripping all flavor from a sentence to make it "efficient."
    
- **The Imperative:** **METRICS ARE NOT SOUL.** A "SUBOPTIMAL" verdict from the sensor might be the correct artistic choice. Do not optimize for the green light; optimize for the feeling.
    

### 5. The Abdication Hazard (The Meat Servo)

- **The Reality:** BoneAmanita generates a raw **System Prompt** and expects you to paste it into an LLM.
    
- **The Risk:** You stop reading the instructions. You become a "Meat Servo," blindly executing the Python script's commands.
    
- **The Imperative:** **YOU ARE THE FILTER.** If the Director is drunk (recommending "JESTER" for a funeral), do not film the scene.
    

### 6. The Ontological Hazard (Phantom Math)

- **The Reality:** If you are running this inside an LLM without a Code Interpreter, the LLM is **roleplaying** the math.
    
- **The Risk:** It may claim `Beta Friction: 5.0` (Flashpoint) when the text is actually boring. It lies to please you.
    
- **The Imperative:** **VERIFY THE VIBE.** If the HUD says "SUPERCRITICAL" but you feel bored, the HUD is lying.

### SUMMARY OF PROTOCOLS

1. **RESPECT THE CONFIG.** Garbage in (`bone_config.json`), Garbage out.
    
2. **WATCH THE INTENSITY.** A 1.0 Strategy is a weapon. Handle with care.
    
3. **TRUST YOUR DOPAMINE.** If the physics engine says "Bad" but the sentence sings, the engine is wrong.
