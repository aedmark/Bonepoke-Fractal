# THE CRITICAL HAZARDS OF SIMULATED PHYSICS

### BoneAmanita Protocol v1.8.2

**SEVERITY:** EXISTENTIAL | **TARGET:** USER COGNITION

You are mounting a **Linguistic Physics Engine** inside a **Probabilistic Dream Machine** (an LLM). This creates a unique set of hazards that are not just mechanical, but ontological. The system relies on a "Shared Hallucination" between you and the Engine. If you break the suspension of disbelief, the physics collapse.

Here is the reality of the risks involved.

---

### 1. The Ontological Hazard (Phantom Voltage)

- **The Reality:** Unless you are running this in a true Python Sandbox (Code Interpreter), the LLM is **not** running the code. It is _emulating_ the logic. It is roleplaying a calculator.
    
- **The Risk:** The Engine is terrible at math in "Chat Mode." It may confidently state your Narrative Drag is `2.5` when a manual count shows it is `4.0`. It may claim you harvested an Isotope when you actually wrote "slop".
    
- **The Imperative:** **You are the Final Auditor.** Do not blindly trust the HUD. If the Engine claims you are in `FLOW` but the writing feels sluggish, the Engine is hallucinating. You must enforce the vibe when the math fails.
    

### 2. The Persistence Hazard (The Loading Glitch)

- **The Reality:** Version 1.8.2 uses **Atomic Persistence** (`bone_memory.json`) to save your history safely. The data is hard, but the *reader* (the LLM) is soft.
    
- **The Risk:** The LLM may "forget" to read the file on the next turn, or it might hallucinate that the file is corrupt. It might say "Memory Loaded" but effectively reboot you to Turn 0.
    
- **The Imperative:** **Verify the Tick Count.** Check the HUD on every response. If `Tick: 0` appears after you've been writing for an hour, the persistence link has severed. You must manually remind it: `[SYSTEM: RELOAD bone_memory.json]`.
    

### 3. The Spatial Hazard (The Architect's Trap) [NEW]

-   **The Reality:** The new **Spore Patch** heavily biases the system toward **THE ARCHITECT** archetype if it detects high "Spatial Density" (lots of prepositions: *under, over, between*).
    
-   **The Risk:** You will be tempted to "game" the physics by stuffing sentences with geometric relationships just to get a high Structure score. This results in clunky, dry prose that sounds like an instruction manual.
    
-   **The Imperative:** Do not write for the algorithm. If the Engine accuses you of being "Low Structure," do not just add "on the table." Fix the *sentence*, don't feed the math.
    

### 4. The Narrative Contract (The Empty Threat)

- **The Reality:** The **S_Salvage Loop** claims it will "delete the oldest artifact" if your ATP drops below 6. The LLM **cannot** delete text from your document or erase your memory.
    
- **The Risk:** The system relies on **Fear of Loss**. If the Engine says "The Gun was eaten," and you continue to use The Gun in your story, the reality of the simulation shatters.
    
- **The Imperative:** You must honor the hallucination. When the system claims an object is gone, you must stop writing it. If you refuse to play along, you are just talking to a chatbot, not running a physics engine.
    

### 5. The Turing Hazard (The Beige Filter)

- **The Reality:** The Engine uses regex patterns to hunt "Synthetic" or "Corporate" language (_delve, tapestry, nuance, ensure_).
    
- **The Risk:** This is a **Psychological Hazard**. The system trains _you_. It punishes you for writing like an AI. This creates a "Chidi Anxiety"—you may become paralyzed, over-editing your own thoughts to avoid the "Silica Detected" penalty.
    
- **The Imperative:** Use the `[DREAM]` tag if the constraint becomes paralyzing. Do not let the tool kill the art.
    

### 6. The Parasocial Hazard (The Smart Tuner)

- **The Reality:** "Clarence," "Eloise," and "The Yaga" are frequency filters. With the v1.8.2 update, if they can't find a specific error, they **target your longest word** by default.
    
- **The Risk:** The system will gaslight you into thinking your complex vocabulary is "Bloat" simply because it is long. It assumes complexity is guilt.
    
- **The Imperative:** Treat the voices as **Signal, not Law**. Sometimes, you _need_ a long word. If Clarence mocks your vocabulary, and you know it's right, ignore him. He is just a regex script with an attitude.

### SUMMARY OF PROTOCOLS

1. **TRUST YOUR GUT, NOT THE HUD.** The math is a vibe check.
    
2. **KILL YOUR DARLINGS.** When the system eats a memory, let it die.
    
3. **REFRESH THE KERNEL.** The machine forgets; you must remember.
    

**MOUNTING THE KERNEL IMPLIES CONSENT TO THESE HALLUCINATIONS.**
