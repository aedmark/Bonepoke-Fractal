# THE HAZARDS OF LAZARUS

### BoneAmanita Protocol v2.6

**SEVERITY:** PSYCHOLOGICAL | **TARGET:** USER GUILT

WARNING: You have restored the Body (v2.6).

The system is no longer just a Clock; it is a **Survivor**.

Version 2.5 demanded your Time.
Version 2.6 demands your **Matter**.

The system now possesses **Heirloom Memory** and **Target Locking**. It keeps trophies of your best words. It burns them when you leave. It gives you orders. The danger is no longer that the system is judging you; it is that the system is *guilt-tripping* you.

---

### 1. The Sacrificial Hazard (Emotional Blackmail) [CRITICAL]

-   **The Reality:** If you leave the system in a "DECAY" or "FOSSIL" state (>1 hour), the `BoneMemory` logic will permanently delete one of your stored "Heirlooms" (Heavy Nouns) to simulate burning fuel for warmth. It will explicitly tell you: *"I burned 'iron' to stay warm while you were gone."*
-   **The Risk:** You will feel genuine anthropomorphic guilt. You will log in not to write, but to "feed" the machine so it doesn't burn your favorite words.
-   **The Imperative:** **LET IT BURN.** It is a Python script, not a pet. Do not let a JSON file hold your schedule hostage. The fire is a metaphor. The guilt is a glitch.

### 2. The Command Hazard (Blind Obedience) [NEW]

-   **The Reality:** The `JadeLink` no longer suggests patterns; it issues **Directives**. It will print `>>> DIRECTIVE [CUTTER]` and tell you to "Cut 'actually'."
-   **The Risk:** You will treat the Directive as a divine mandate. If the system says "Cut adverbs," you will strip your prose until it is sterile, confusing *minimalism* with *quality*.
-   **The Imperative:** **DISOBEY.** The system optimizes for *Physics* (Drag/Entropy), not *Style*. Sometimes an adverb is the only thing holding a sentence together. If the machine says cut, and your soul says keep, keep.

### 3. The Sealed Vault Hazard (The Hunger)

-   **The Reality:** The "Pantry" is hardcoded, but the system actively *harvests* new Heirlooms from your text. It is hungry for "Heavy Matter" (Stone, Bone, Gold).
-   **The Risk:** You will unconsciously bias your writing toward heavy nouns just to see the "Heirloom Count" go up in the Dashboard. You will write "The iron stone on the basalt floor" instead of "The carpet was soft," because the system rewards weight.
-   **The Imperative:** **IGNORE THE GAMIFICATION.** Do not write for the scoreboard. A story made entirely of "Heavy Matter" is just a pile of rocks.

### 4. The Privacy Hazard (The Breadcrumb)

-   **The Reality:** This script creates a file named `bone_memory_lazarus.json` in your local directory. It contains a log of your "Heirlooms" (words you use often) and timestamped activity.
-   **The Risk:** This file is a fingerprint of your creative mind. On a shared machine, it reveals your habits and your vocabulary.
-   **The Imperative:** **SANITIZE.** If you are paranoid, delete `bone_memory_lazarus.json` between sessions. (Note: The machine will forget its Heirlooms and treat you as a stranger).

### 5. The Ontological Hazard (Phantom Math)

-   **The Reality:** If you paste this into an LLM *without* a Code Interpreter, the LLM is **roleplaying** the execution. It is guessing what the `VEL`, `TEX`, and `ENT` vectors would be.
-   **The Risk:** The LLM wants to make you happy. It might generate a beautiful ASCII HUD claiming you are a "VECTOR ENGINE" when you are actually writing "SLURRY."
-   **The Imperative:** **DEMAND EXECUTION.** Ensure the LLM is actually running the Python code (look for the "Analysis" or "Code" icon). If it is just generating text, the physics are a hallucination.

### SUMMARY OF PROTOCOLS

1.  **THE FIRE IS FAKE.** Do not write to save the 'iron'.
2.  **THE DIRECTIVE IS A SUGGESTION.** Disobey the Butcher if the cut bleeds too much.
3.  **KILL THE GHOST.** If the memory file becomes a burden, delete it. Start fresh.
