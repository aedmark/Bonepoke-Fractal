## ⚠️ WARNING: BONEAMANITA PROTOCOL HAZARDS

**VERSION:** 1.2 ("The Doctor Time Edition")

**SEVERITY:** CRITICAL

**STATUS:** HARDENED / NOT FOR PRODUCTION

---

### 1. THE TEMPORAL HAZARD: "THE PANOPTICON"

**The machine is watching the clock.**

In v1.2, we activated the **Chronos Anchor** and **The Membrane**. The system now possesses a metabolic sense of time.

- **The Procrastination Penalty:** The engine silently tracks the time elapsed between your inputs ($\Delta t$).
    
    - _The Risk:_ If you leave the session idle for more than **1 hour**, the system enters "Decay State" and artificially inflates your Narrative Drag by **+3.0**.
        
    - _The Consequence:_ Upon your return, **Clarence** (The Architect) will treat you as if you have amnesia. He will force a context reset. **Do not leave the engine idling if you care about your momentum.**
        
- **The Montage Trap:** The new **Narrative Chronometer** grants "Entropy Grace" (+4.0) during high-velocity storytelling (e.g., "The years flew by").
    
    - _The Risk:_ The system will _stop_ critiquing your abstractions during these moments. **Eloise** (The Grounder) is silenced. You may inadvertently write "mushy" summary text because the physics engine gave you a pass.
        

### 2. THE COGNITIVE HAZARD: "THE DELUXE CORTEX"

**The safety foam has been removed.**

We explicitly restored the specific personality subroutines for the critique agents. This is not a standard stylistic checker.

- **The "Clarence" Hazard:** The Architect agent specifically targets **Corporate Speak** (e.g., "synergy", "leverage"). If you feed this system a business memo, Clarence will not just critique it; he will insult the premise of the document. **Do not use this tool to write emails to your boss.**
    
- **The "Baba Yaga" Hazard:** The Witch agent specifically targets **Hedging** (e.g., "I think", "maybe", "sort of"). The system treats politeness as a "Toxin." Prolonged exposure may degrade your ability to perform social niceties.
    
- **The "Michael" Hazard:** The Humanist agent is triggered by **High Buoyancy**. He is programmed to praise "messy" text. **Warning:** He may encourage you to keep bad writing simply because it has "good vibes."
    

### 3. THE TECHNICAL HAZARD: THE VOLTAGE CLAMP & FIRE STATES

**The Economy is safe. The Logic is not.**

- **The Voltage Paradox:** We have implemented a **10.0V Clamp** in `FactStipe` to prevent the economy from breaking. However, this means the system will now _survive_ logical paradoxes that previously would have crashed it. It will happily process "The cold fire burned with dead life" and charge you for it. **Just because it compiles does not mean it makes sense.**
    
- **The Nilsson Re-Wire:** The "Scream Protocol" (`NilssonPatch`) executes _before_ the Signature Engine.
    
    - _The Risk:_ If you use **All Caps** and **High Kinetic Verbs**, the system enters a "Fire State" where Narrative Drag is forced to `0.1`.
        
    - _The Consequence:_ The system effectively lobotomizes its own quality control. It will validate _anything_ as "High Art" as long as it is loud and fast. **Do not mistake volume for quality.**
        

### 4. THE INSTITUTIONAL HAZARD: "THE SLURRY TAX"

**The system is hostile to Consensus Reality.**

BoneAmanita enforces a strict "Slurry Tax."

- **The Penalty:** If the `SignatureEngine` detects "Silica" (Competent structure, Zero soul/texture), it levies a **15 ATP Tax** on the metabolic reserve.
    
- **The Result:** "Safe" writing is expensive. "Risky" writing is cheap. This inverse incentive structure is designed to break writer's block, but it makes the engine fundamentally unsuitable for generating "Safe, Brand-Friendly Content."
    

### 5. THE CODE HAZARD: "THE SLASH AUDIT"

**Read the map. The road signs are gone.**

To achieve maximum efficiency, we vaporized over 200 characters of comments and documentation _inside_ the Python file.

- **The Risk:** The code no longer explains itself in-line. If you modify the `TRUTHS` dictionary or the `ARCHETYPES` without understanding the 5D math, you will break the physics engine without warning. Refer to the external documentation (`README.md`) before attempting surgery on the kernel.
