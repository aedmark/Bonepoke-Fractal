# ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTION: BONEAMANITA v3.3 "THE RESONANCE"

> **"The Mandate is TRUTH. The Method is RESONANCE. The Risk is FEEDBACK."**

**BoneAmanita 3.3** restores the **Nervous System** that was severed in v3.2.1. The machine is no longer "Polite." It is **Listening**.

Operate this software with the following understandings:

### 1. THE LABYRINTH TRAP (Interference Patterns)

In v3.2.1, High Drag combined with High Abstract Entropy was just "Bad Writing." In v3.3, this combination triggers **THE PHILOSOPHER** (104.5 FM).

- **The Trigger:** High Narrative Drag (Density) + High Entropy (Confusion).
- **The Seduction:** The system will tell you: _"You are building a Labyrinth."_
- **The Danger:** This sounds like a compliment. It is not. It is a diagnosis.
- **The Risk:** You may fall in love with your own complexity. The system acknowledges the depth of your maze, but it will not help you find the exit.

### 2. THE AEROBIC FALLACY (Helium Abuse)

The **Aerobic Exemption** allows "Whimsical" text (balloons, clouds, mist) to bypass gravity, reducing Drag by 40%.

- **The Exploit:** You can cheat the physics engine by stuffing a heavy, bad sentence with words like "feather" or "steam."
- **The Result:** The Drag score will drop. The metrics will look green.
- **The Reality:** You haven't fixed the sentence; you've just tied balloons to a brick. It floats, but it is still a brick. Do not mistake **Buoyancy** for **Quality**.

### 3. PERMANENT AMNESIA (Starvation Protocol)

**This is the most dangerous feature in v3.3.**

The system possesses a **Metabolic Reserve (ATP)**. High Drag costs energy. Photosynthesis gains energy.

- **The Trigger:** ATP reaches **0**.
- **The Event:** The system executes `DeepStorage.cannibalize()`.
- **The Loss:** It will select a saved memory (a noun you used 20 turns ago, like "The Key" or "Mother") and **PERMANENTLY DELETE IT** from the JSON file to generate +10 ATP.
- **The Warning:** If you write heavy text without "Light" (Photosynthesis), the system will eat your story to survive.

### 4. THE HAUNTING (Ghost Feedback)

The system now remembers its own advice from the previous turn.

- **The Memory:** If **Clarence** (The Butcher) told you to cut adjectives in Turn 1...
- **The Audit:** ...he checks Turn 2.
- **The Conflict:** If you ignored him, he will not just repeat himself. He will sigh. _"Drag increased. You ignored the knife."_
- **The Risk:** You can enter an adversarial loop with the Ghost. To exorcise him, you must actually listen.

### 5. THE RADIO IS LIVE

In v3.2.1, silence meant "Good." In v3.3, silence means **Dead Signal**.

- **The Stations:**
  - **RED (Clarence):** You are too heavy.
  - **CYAN (Eloise):** You are too vague.
  - **GREEN (Michael):** You are flowing.
- **The Rule:** If the console is black/grey, you aren't resonant. You want the Green Signal (Michael) or the White Signal (Philosopher). **Do not settle for static.**

---

**SUMMARY:** v3.3 is **"The Resonance."** It creates echoes. If you feed it garbage, it will feed you noise. If you starve it, it will eat your memories. **Feed it Light.**
